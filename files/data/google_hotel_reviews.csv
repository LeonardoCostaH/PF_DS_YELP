I work from home and school , and random people just come in almost everyday and just unlock your door and come in with out notice . Even if your not dressed. I feel there is no privacy.  There has been stuff missing from my apartment I don't know if it's staff or a roommate that recently moved out. Don't even feel safe here, it's loud. Also they charge fees that aren't explained.

107061490130823978766,1567051054280,"The place is fine. The management needs an overhaul. They haven’t gotten the addresses down and I couldn’t change my address with the post office. Beyond that, the parking garage is an utter mess. The first car you see when pulling in has been hit several times, most clearly because the spot shouldn’t have been put there. Beyond that, they have two types of parking inside the garage. Reserved and unreserved. Unbeknownst to the residents, the unreserved parking pass is numbered similar to the reserved. It’s a piece of trash if you ask me. Either assign all the spots or don’t assign any spots. But don’t assign a few spots and then not others, but still number the unreserved parking passes like you do the reserved. If you need to keep track of the unreserved parking passes, use a 4-digit code or letters. Stop being so ambiguous with your parking.

Beyond that, they installed speed bumps inside the garage to slow down traffic. As if the super tight corners with vehicles sticking out into travel lanes weren’t enough. There has to be some law about speed bumps because these are much too steep and my car scrapes the ground going just 5 mph.

They should have hired a different engineer to design the garage and a new management team to do the parking.

Edit:
It has been four days since I made this review. I got a reply within a day but have yet to be contacted by the apartment. I also have had to park on the roof of the garage two days in a row. If I am not getting covered parking, I want a refund for the extra money I am paying. The complex should assign parking spots to every resident and this problem would be much less of an annoyance, but for the time being, I cannot go out without losing my covered parking spot. Other reviews echo my gripes of the poor parking setup and I will be calling Peak Campus soon if this can’t be resolved in house.

Beyond that, the WiFi is incredibly underwhelming. I was expecting 2 Gbps and am getting maybe 4 Mbps. That’s a grossly slow alternative.","Jacob,  Thank you for taking the time to write this review.

Update: The apartment is good. The furniture is what was showed. I am really pleased with that. However, the amenities aren't what they advertised. First, ""voice controlled Smart thermostat, lights, ceiling fan and door lock"" is a lie if you don't set up on your own. I asked for the instructionsne because  one of them told me that the instructions were in the move in envelope. He started to look for them, but surprise, there were not instructions. He asked to one of his coworkers and that one came and told me to look for tutorials. The internet had plenty of them.

The pool is just your average pool but the area has a lounge and grills if you want to host a party. They also pick up trash every day Monday - Thursday (there is a fee for this). The buildings are pretty well built as far as I can tell. The my only complaints would be the doors. My bedroom door has to be slammed to be closed and my bathroom door doesn't even close at all. Besides that, the construction was very well done. Everything seems to work as it should and have not had any problems with appliances so far.

It was her first two weeks at she was absolutely precious and made sure I felt comfortable. There was a blonde woman who at one point handed me the bottom of my fitted dress and shooed me off the stage, very rude. She realized this after I said I didn't want to try on anymore and showed me around the showroom to see if I liked anything else, honestly even if I did I wouldn't buy there. They did have some curvy girl styles and the store was very clean but the way I was treated by some of the staff was shocking. Five stars for Audrey because she's a peach, definitely ask to work with her! Two stars for everything else.","Hi Nicole!  Thank you so much for the kind words on Audrey, we love her too!  For all of our bridal clients we help them by handing them the bottom of the gown to make it easier for walking.  Our stage has a few steps and we want all of our clients to feel comfortable walking and managing the layers of the gowns.  I do believe there was a miscommunication, when one of our owners saw you about to step down to walk she stepped in to hand you the bottom to make it easier for walking.  We understand when you work in the bridal industry that it is hard to find your dream gown at times because you see so many pretty dresses.  We loved chatting with you about the different options there would be for upcoming new arrivals and customizing.  Thank you so much for choosing to shop with us.  We did call you and chat more about this over the phone.  Customer service is very important to us!  Have a great evening.",1603490733220.0,0x87c910edd655edc5:0x195da668cb9a405d

Melissa (no longer works there) helped me pick out my dress on visit #1. I tried on about 20+ dresses and she was so patient with me. She gave me some tips without being overly pushy. She gave me the freedom of going through the store's selection of dresses to pick out my own or she would pull some herself for me to try on. The remaining visits I mainly dealt with Myka (the owner I believe). She has such a sweet soul. Very warm personality. I had some unexpected financial trouble and family issues that made this experience challenging. But they were all so kind and understanding.

Probably the best maintained resort in the Mtn Home /Baxter County area with 2 beautiful boat docks in a private Teal Point Cove. The owners, Karl & Regina, have maintained this resort with the same high quality year after year. AAA gives them their highest ratings.

105548219173902333923,1556765056623,"I have been a resident at Clearwater since 2012, and my husband transferred from Ohio in and moved in, in 2011. We originally lived in a smaller apartment. We looked at other apartments, but we decided to stay here and move into a bigger apartment. We moved out of the smaller apartment in 2014. I am a very clean person, and we do our own steam cleaning of carpets. While my husband and son was moving our belongings to the other apartment, I was cleaning the apartment I was moving out of. I made sure I did a walk through with management, and took pictures. I also took pictures of my new apartment. There were some issues with the new apartment that were not seen with the walk through but were addressed and fixed.
I have now lived in this apartment since 2014, 4 years! residents for 7 years! It is hard to believe, and it has flown by! I had great neighbors at the other apartment and great neighbors here with an occasional one that don't stick around long. My bestfriend, has turned out to be neighbor! I have gone through 3 owners, and I think 3 different managers. Mel has been manager twice.
Maintenance is always very friendly, quick, and things get fixed usually the day you report it. I have called to have my mini-blinds replaced, and also slats in the living room blinds. If you call and have these things fixed, you do not get charged, but if they have to do it, then you will. Point is, KEEP YOUR APARTMENT UP!
When the original owners built these apartments in 2008, they didn't think things through. They did not allow enough parking spots for each apartment, and the management won't do anything to solve the parking issue. I am disabled, and have a handicap placard so I now have a parking spot.
( I have several diseases that keep me from being able to walk very far without becoming dehydrated and exhausted. I can not lift heavy items and carry them especially for long distances. I have medical devices implanted that can come lose and cause complications and even death. With that being said, I have a handicap permanent placard. I chose it over a license plate so I can take it with me if I am in a vehicle with someone else, and I am planning to buy another vehicle. You can not remove a license plate from one vehicle to another. In the Unit I live, it isn't a handicap unit. There are no handicap spots. The manager told me to bring my paperwork in to get my handicap parking spot. I did just that last year. There are others that live in my complex that are handicapped and still don't park there. But, I have a neighbor that the rules have not applied to him or his wife since they have moved in. They have not called him and told him he needed to being in paperwork for another handicap parking spot. Maybe it's petty. But, it shows the lack of respect for other residents. I don't know if we will be renewing our lease. I am tired of rules only applying to certain people!)

Mel was able to resolve my issue, and I am very happy with it. The other tenant was given the same option but chose against it. The rules were pushed on the tenant when he parked in my assigned handicap parking spot.  Once again, I am pleased with Clearwater, not all staff. But, I am happy again!",,,0x88690be108616c4f:0x3af918de2601905f

112076919084694673931,1622050123198,"UPDATE: Been here now for almost a year and since the upstairs neighbors have moved it has been much better. Rent increase for the next year lease is reasonable. Any upstairs apartment should be fully carpeted to minimize the noise to the people living downstairs. Living on the first floor has not been the best experience. Adding a star. If there is continued improvement with living here I will add another. So far this has not been a very good experience. Having to come back three times just to view the layout I was interested in should have been a tip off. Why make an appointment and then keep it without checking first to make sure you have an apartment to show? Anyway, I see the layout and it's close to work so I accept an apartment. They present me with a lease and oops forgot to give credit for the concession. So the lease has to be redone. Then I ask for a washer and dryer. Extra $35.00 a month, the convenience makes the price reasonable to me. So they add it to my lease, but guess what? None are available due to covid. So I am added to a list of people that are waiting but told I am second on the list. Washer and dryers come in last week. I get a call and i am told over 3 days they will be installed. They don't come the 1st day, 2nd day or even the 3rd day. On top of it I have yet to receive a credit for the payment made on them without having them. I am on the first floor and above me is a 3 bedroom with more people living in the apartment than I think is allowed, but I could be wrong on this. There is a lot of people though and the noise never seems to end up there. Really frustrated at this point. The people in the office are nice but when you feel like you are lied to constantly than what good is a smiling face? Hopefully things will get better but so far this has been very close to awful.","Ian Grossman, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.",1622656249542.0,0x88690be108616c4f:0x3af918de2601905f

105812186818421845232,1492444223486,Worst management ever. I have enjoyed living here up until today. I'm threatened that my car will be towed if I don't stop parking in front of the mailboxes by my apartment because other people's guests take up all the spaces I pay $900 a month to come home to no parking spaces and I'm the bad guy. They're not holding up their end of the lease on those 2 parking spaces they lie about. The guy who I talked to me was more worried about my being upset than solving the problem. He felt the need to try to assert himself and in the end tells me I have to come up to the office spaces to park I calmed myself and left instead of going on because I've only been this mad a handful of times in my life and it was only getting worse. YUNI and JANE need to be managing everything they're amazing anybody else can kiss my ass including the lame ass maintenance guy who tried to call me inconsiderate because I want to park where I live.,,,0x88690be108616c4f:0x3af918de2601905f

117111705067670165600,1586917398470,"We’ve enjoyed the year we’ve lived at Brookview/Echelon.

We moved here because of concern for my wife’s health. She has a terrible mold allergy and has been sick at every other apartment we’ve lived at in Louisville. No mold problems for us here! She has been well for the first time in years living here. We could not be more grateful.

The staff has been fantastic to work with — helpful with maintenance and have even been willing to work with us to extend our lease as we’ve experienced a delayed in our plans to move to Ethiopia due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Andrea came on as the new Community Manager a few months back and has done an excellent job with the transition. She has been diligent to make necessary changes, communicate regularly, and even think of creative ways to keep the community here connected both to one another and to the staff during the COVID-19.

The location is great too. Kroger, Target, and Walmart all just next door. Great restaurants within just a few minute drive.

I’d highly recommend moving here.","What a wonderful review, Josh - thank you! It is always a joy to know that our residents are loving our amazing community. We are thrilled to have Andrea with us and at the helm. Thank you again for your fantastic review and for taking the time to share your thoughts with us on how our community has impacted your life for the better. We will all miss you so much when it is your time to move. - The Brookview at Middletown Team -",1593479391283.0,0x886998b4805857ad:0x54e7e8b9583bbd64
104696282904772444306,1538570391626,"Visited a friend there. Definitely not child friendly with grates for water drainage loose. The grass looks half dead and I noticed other residents walking their dogs very close to the buildings along the sidewalk.  I noticed very few trees for shade, no real landscaping and bags of trash sitting on everyone's stoop. I was told this is a ""concierge service "" where they come pick it up for you.  It just added to the smell. I only saw inside the one unit but I was not impressed.  The open floor plan leaves a lot to be desired. If you love to cook it will smell up the entire place and coat all your belongings in the living room since there are no walls or decent ventilation to clear it up.  The rest of the insides are pretty basic and mediocre,  esp for the price. I pay less where I am and have more space, plus I have a small fenced yard (NO poop from the neighbors dogs) and while this place is in a close proximity to major chain retailers and the expressway for convenience, you are surrounded by major roads on 3 sides giving you a high amount of pollution and very little natural landscape.  When you pull out to leave you see the back of a strip mall and huge abandoned lot where truckers park for the night or waiting to make deliveries.  All in all,  it's just not what you would expect for the price and I am sure I missed a lot of details since I was only a visitor.","Thanks for sharing your review, Kris.

Walked in to be greeted by Rachel- big smile on her face and she was incredibly kind. You instantly feel welcomed.
Carter had me choose an oil scent for my neck and shoulder massage while my stylist finished up her client. Y'all, I didn't even know that was a thing. It was a great start to my experience.
Danielle did my haircut and I really could not be more pleased. She did a great consult before waving her magic shears, even took notes on what she was doing and the products she planned on using so there was a record. She nailed everything I wanted and I am incredibly pleased with my haircut!
The details- the neck message in the beginning, then a hand/arm massage at the shampoo station, a warm eye mask, having a customized greeting at the stylist station.. they really take the time to make your experience the best it can be.
Highly highly highly recommend.","Jules, we're not exaggerating when we say this kind review brought tears to our eyes! Thank you for sharing in such detail about your Neatbeat experience.

102858147795351430264,1424211874020,"I could write a book about how much I enjoyed my visit here. I did a lot of research before choosing Neatbeat, and chose them because of the glowing reviews online and the convenient location. I have only ever been to cheap chain salons and haven't walked out completely happy with my cut in, well, years.

The first thing I noticed about Neatbeat was that the outside is friendly and inviting. They have a running list of things they're thankful for posted outside the front door. I was greeted by a cheery chalkboard sandwich sign, listing the names of the customers who had appointments for that day- ""Hello, gorgeous!"" And the inside of the salon is adorable. It looks like a Pinterest page come to life. I was offered a drink (I declined) and was asked to fill out a short survey before meeting with my stylist. Not only did it ask for basic contact info and the usual questions, but it also had fun things, like my favorite flavor of coffee and my favorite music artist.

My stylist was Alexa, and she did such an excellent job. She looked at the pictures I had saved (one for my bangs, one for the rest of my hair) and asked lots of questions to be sure she could help me get what I wanted, including what kinds of products I usually use on my hair (shampoo) and what level of styling I'm comfortable with. I then got my ""neck treatment"" before my hair was even washed. This included the use of the essential oil of my choice and a neck and shoulder massage. It was absolutely lovely, and something I've never experienced before. I was then led to the ""Love Shack,"" a comfortable nook where the hair-washing takes place. The reclining seats even had footrests! I always think that having my hair washed by someone else is very relaxing, and it's my favorite part of any haircut. Neatbeat made the experience even better, as I received a ""warm eye pillow"" and an amazing hand massage once the shampoo and conditioner had been rinsed out. After that, we got to the cutting. Alexa was meticulous and thorough, again, doing everything possible to make sure that I got the cut I wanted. She also offered advice for caring for my new hairstyle at home, including what simple products to use and how to train my part to be further over (a requirement for my desired style.) She explained everything every step of the way, which was really helpful for me, since I've never really done anything for my hair other than washing it! All in all, the experience took almost two hours, but I appreciated not being rushed- it was clear that my needs and wants were being put first.

I ran errands after getting my hair done, and I felt such a happy boost in my confidence and self-esteem, like I've never experienced before. All thanks to the ladies at Neatbeat! Weeks later, I am still getting compliments from friends, family, and folks at work, and I don't hesitate for a second to recommend Neatbeat. When I tell them about my experience, they seem a little envious and express an interest in going, but they are absolutely floored when I tell them how affordable it was (my morning cost $29!)

I am now willing my hair to grow faster so I can go back as soon as possible.",,,0x8869a06cc79adfc1:0xb01c331fcdda2f17

We evaluated 7 different companies. Quality Granite (Peter & Harley) gave us a positive, consultative experience in the store, which really set a standard for the balance of our decision-making process. There is also an excellent selection of in-stock granite that you can look at in-person. Reviews and BBB ratings are solid and I appreciated how people detailed the way they handled problems that arose.

Vs. Competition:  Prices were on the higher side of the middle of our quotes, but we heavily discounted our experience with the others. In some cases, we were ignored in the showroom, quotes took over a week and still had bad information, people weren't knowledgeable, horrible reviews and bad reports of problem handling.

We were between Quality and Bob's Granite but preferred Quality so asked them to review the quote. They were able to bring the price down some due to the size of the job and stock of the product we wanted. While we may have still gone with Quality in the long-run, this made it far easier for us to make a quick decision. We booked immediately, put a down payment and Chris was out to measure the following day. Counter tops were installed a few days after that!

The installers work directly for Quality and are not outsourced (This was important to us). They were very consultative, friendly and extremely professional. We paid for them to remove the existing counter tops and haul it away. They were highly knowledgeable and gave us some recommendations to strengthen the support for the bar area. They did a very nice job of install overall and took our payment.

Our only problem was that we had a small scratch that I noticed after they left and that the hole cut for the electrical box was slightly too small. I noted this immediately and had a response back saying they would take care of it. It did take a few weeks for this to get done due to scheduling (on both our parts), with maybe a little more follow up on my part than theirs. However; Chris (the owner) came, fixed the scratch and fixed the hole and made sure we were extremely satisfied before he left and in the end, that's all we cared about. He even arrived prepared to replace the piece, if necessary.

113224953711849765241,1556477786681,"Our appointment was at 11 for a couples massage.  We were told the day before on the phone (by the owner) to show up at 10:30 to use the sauna.  We show up at 10:25 and the door is locked with nobody in sight.  We knocked and called the number only to be immediately transferred to a voicemail.  We left a message and sat in our car right in front of the door in the parking lot.  No call back and we sat there for 30+ minutes until all the sudden everyone started emerging from the back.  Very annoying to sit there and feel like the place isn't even open and their hours say open 10 to 4.  We literally almost left.

My wife really wanted to enjoy the sauna before hand, clearly that didn't happen.  I find it extremely unprofessional to ignore the door and just lock out any upcoming customers arriving for their appointment until you're done with current clients.  Someone working the front seems a little necessary here. I was shocked to see how many employees were actually inside the whole time while we were sitting in our car locked out.

Then there's the massage, specifically mine.  My wife was happy with her massage, which is great.  Mine felt completely amateur.  Erratic movement, poking and pinching and not too mention a nail that needed trimming that was constantly scratching me.  She left my arms hanging off the table so long that I was losing circulation to my hands. I felt like there was no real techniques used on me to release tension, knots, or simply relax me at all.  Literally squeezing my neck with two fingers like any normal person would. Her movements were jumping around all over the place so much that I couldn't figure out the intent of really anything going on.  She just seemed lost and inexperienced.

I've had lots of massages over the years and I find them necessary to keep me comfortable with my work.  If my person actually is a licensed therapist, I would be surprised because it felt extremely unprofessional across the board.  I was never even asked once if the pressure was ok, and when we came out of our room the therapists weren't even there to make sure we were happy...never seen that before today.  Usually we are handed a glass of water and talked to for a minute.  Nope, not here.... your glass of water is left at the front counter where you check out, ha.  At least I assumed that was our water because nobody actually gave it to us.  Quite the way of saying get the hell out, I find that rude and impersonal. I'm sure there is talent scattered in this establishment, but I certainly didn't see it.  I was surprised because this place has been there for a while.  We left tips simply out of respect.  But, we will absolutely not be returning.","Thank you for leaving this feedback, Kris. Clearly we have room for improvement and I can assure you that this will be handled.

101209792293131512623,1519950109698,I live about 45 minutes away. Made an appointment for 4:30. I called to let them know I would be about 10 minutes behind due to traffic and the lady ask me can I come tomorrow after being almost there. This would have been my first time going to them and this first impression is not good. They should keep up with scheduled appointments because I had to work and that was my only day free and that was the whole point of me scheduling an appointment. It was a total inconvenience all the way around and I am highly disappointed in that customer service. This is not very satisfying at all and I had to take my business elsewhere.,"I'm so sorry for what happened but, I just asked you if you can come next because it will be little late and you hang up on me.

Everyone was EXTREMELY kind, and super helpful with the application process and information, even though we were moving from across the country. They've gone out of their way to make sure everything is perfect and up to par, and the few concerns we had were immediately addressed.

The apartments and surrounding area are very clean and well maintained, and all of the neighbors seem to be very friendly, and all seem happy to be living here. The apartments themselves aren't anything too special or fancy, but are nice, and also the cheapest around (when we moved in at least). We rarely hear any noise from our neighbors, even though we are in the middle floor , and when we do it is barely loud enough to hear.

The maintenance crew is also great, they stopped in twice to touch up some areas in the apartment from the last tenant, and were very professional and friendly. They're always around cleaning up the area and working on apartments keeping everything looking great.

The events the staff puts on are alot of fun for all. I especially loved the oyster roast. Keep up the good work guys.","Hello,  Thank you so much for your positive comments about Ashton Woods!

Fridge didn't work, after complaining every day I was there I never got a working one, even after being switched to another room, which had bed bugs, so the following day I had to be moved to another room.  My 3 children where bitten by bed bugs all on their bodies, and the lady in the room next to us (who had been there 6 months) said they knew there where bed bugs in that room before they put me in there.  They didn't give any discount, nor did they help to pay for washing and drying EVERYTHING in the room so that the bugs wouldn't come with us.  The power went in and out in half of the last room they put us in, I had to switch the breaker constantly in the hallway.  During our 2 month stay, housekeeping did not come not ONE SINGLE TIME.  I just can't say enough how much this place needs to be shut down.  Save yourselfor the aggregation and time and go somewhere else!!!!!

***UPDATE

ON my final day at Carolina Lodge, a male ran into my room, where myself andidn't my 4 year old and 2 year old son where, and robbed, beat, and held a gun to my head!  DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE, IT NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN!!!!!!!

Since Southwood Reality has taken over, we have had the same Property Manager and Maintenance Manager who are totally focused on the needs of the residents. The previous owner had a revolving door of personnel in their last years of ownership. I have stayed here because the floor plan of the apartment is perfect for me and I really love the location being close to shopping, restaurants, recreation and medical facilities. It is especially nice being a part of a neighborhood where you can go walking or biking. Expect a positive experience if you move here.","Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this positive review and 5-star rating. We love to hear our residents feedback.

Ashley was who I booked my apt with and she was amazing. Had a great personality and she was very nice. She made sure I was comfortable and made sure the pressure of my massage wasn't to much so I was able to enjoy the massage instead of having to much pressure and it hurting me. She also keep conversation with me and allowed me to talk her head off. I'm a stay at home mom with a 19 month old boy and 4 month old girl so getting opportunities to enjoy a massage and actually have a adult conversation doesn't come often for me so I was very satisfied with my experience here and would recommend to anyone.,Thank you Aimee!

Magnolia park is a very nice and clean community. I apologize that you may have seen it in a unusual condition. Our groundskeeper works very hard to keep the community at its best. I have taken into consideration the comment that you have made about the community, and I assure you we will make sure our community is never in the condition that you may have seen it in ever again. We will be sure to schedule a power wash for the breezeways as soon as possible. Again, I do apologize, and I hope that first impression did not make you uninterested in our community.

The bathroom sinks had a weird filter on them that made the water sprinkle out, making it weird to wash hands or rise anything.  The water tasted weird from the tap. The entrance gate was broken for the entire 3 weeks we were there. Key fob remote didn’t work, had to actually stop at the sensor and wave it. Since the gate was broken, the gym  wasn’t accessible (same key fob issue). Therefore, often times had to wait for someone to show up in the office to go workout.

Customer service is/has been slow to respond to accomodating parking spaces. I'm still waiting on it and it's been 3 months. It's difficult to carry heavy groceries up 3 flights of stairs (no elevators) from a parking space far away from the building because of the limited amount of designated disability parking.

I agree with other tenants who've posted here, the walls are paper thin. It's ridiculous that I have to hear screaming, out of control children throwing temper tantrums all hours of the day! What wonderful parenting. It's difficult enough to sleep due to chronic back pain, but now I have to sleep with a noise machine to drown out the temper tantrums at 2am!

Some have complained of noise and other issues and although I have heard faint voices once or twice through the wall, it's been a very quiet friendly community! (I just hope that doesn't mean I'm the loud one!)

What I don't like is how poorly insulated the apartment is. I'm on the first floor, but I can hear everything that's going on in the apartment above me. I can hear the conversations, I can hear them using the bathroom, everything! It's frustrating, it feels like there's no privacy. And also, not too many people clean up after their dogs. There's piles of dog poop everywhere and it's really bad in the dog park. I've had to go clean up other people's dog's mess just so my dog had a clean place to play fetch. I think that people really only use the dog parks for letting their dogs potty, and not for exercise or playing. I actually had a neighbor approach and ask me if I could not play ball with my dog while he had his dogs there because it distracted them from taking a poop! Rude!

Our shower has been broken for months, over 4 separate attempts to fix left it in the same condition. Wiring randomly trips the ground fault circuit. One of the grills is missing all the control knobs. The vaccum for the car wash station doesn't work. Gym equipment sits broken for months and then just gets removed for months at a time.

Last year the pool was literally cloudy and uncleaned for long periods of time. Community trash cans often are overflowing. Pool tiles get broken and remain that way for months.

However, I’ve had my nails for just one week and this is the current state of them. 🙃 I’d been postponing getting my nails done because it’s quite a luxury for me right now and I finally decided to get them done. I walked in and everyone immediately welcomed me, and even offered a complimentary drink. That was great! Everyone was genuinely so nice. I want to really really like this place, but I’m not paying $40+ just for people to be nice to me. I want a set of nails that will last 2-3 weeks atleast. Maybe it was just a bad set, I don’t know.

105099702147785373991,1566244511780,"Worst experience ever. I left after  75 mins (and I only received a pedicure).  I went with a girlfriend this Sunday. We wanted to get manicures & pedicures.  Because of the promotion,  we got the deluxe spa pedicures. There were three people working. One man and two women. When we got seated, one of the women started our foot-baths, she then proceeded to give me a pedicure &then did the same to my girlfriend. We never got our cuticles removed, the application of the nail polish was sloppy (see pictures), and honestly she was just trying to rush since the gentleman seated about 4 other people from when our service started. As stated, we wanted to get manicures, after waiting about 20 more mins, she was clearly having to finish up two other pedicures before being able to attend to us. The whole vibe was awkward. I think when the other people got seated, the 2 women got mad at the male employee, and they must have exchanged words, since the pregnant employee ended up crying while giving another customer her pedicure. As you can see, we felt like we needed to leave. I told the women that we didn't believe the charges were fair since neither me or my friend received the ""12 minute massage"", our polish job was sloppy & no cuticles were removed, she disagreed. My friend was getting her dip removed. THE POLISH WAS NOT REMOVED AND THEY CHARGED HER $10.00. This was a horrible experience.

105749703185903859950,1480518074644,"There are a lot of hidden and random fees. $75 if you want to use the club house, $25 valet trash fee (which is not consistently picked up, and not optional) but then you are paying a trash pickup fee, and a fee for them to split the bill between residents.

Parking is an issue, with some choosing to park in the street and in front of garages every night. There is a large dumpster that has been sitting outside the pool area for over a month now.

Add to this, everything is VERY cheap and maintenance, especially painting is awful. My toilet constantly leaks water because they painted the inside of it!! The fireplace brick is made of cheap concrete that fell apart after our first three fires. The dishwasher was screwed into a felt pad under the cabinet which has completely fallen apart within a month. Only about half of our screens fit the windows, and maintenance either doesn't care or isn't funded to properly fix issues, so none of these things have been fixed.

As a final note, after moving in we found that there was a major cockroach problem. Maintenance bug bombed the place twice with no effect, causing me to spray and place bait at our own cost, and they are just finally starting to die off.

The unit prices are decent for the area, but you get what you pay for.  Management is working on improving the complex, but I am not convinced they are putting the money in a manner that they (or you) will actually see improvements.",,,0x88f8a361fdf8bd13:0x1922c8532d427430

Grounds include a small dog park & big dog park. Downside that it's dirt or mulch and not grass, but still nice to have a place for the dogs to run.
Have had no problems with apartment or neighbors. We live right above the pool and even though the kids are loud playing you can't hear them from inside!!! Very happy about this.
It can get hard to find a parking spot near your apartment since there is no designated spots.

Overall I love living here.

She is not focused, makes the process way more difficult than necessary. She has done this numerous times, yet gives you the run around unnecessarily. She has said everything she can say to put off my initial screening. Unfortunately, I did not come to my next appointment because she was moody, unprofessional and unnecessarily distracted from making this happen. I rather go to a property that handles move-ins in a more ethical manner. This review should be handled by the property’s management company.",,,0x8858485cbff46009:0x1af85fc5c7019474

The office is nice with a 'beach grandma' feel to it. I've already recommended this place to coworkers and family because I feel confident this is the best care in the area. There is always a constant playing of varied music so the silence isn't so awkward. The rooms are quite chilly so I recommend to bring a jacket.

They also pay close attention to details. My latex allergy was no problem and when they found out I hadn't had anything since 7am with an appointment time of 4pm, she gave me a Capri Sun juice and a nutrigrain bar to minimize the chance of fainting.

Prices are incredibly reasonable. I paid $114 for 2 teeth removed by an extraction and a surgical extraction. This is a bargain compared to the $138 I paid at Prince Creek dental for a simple extraction of one tooth.

When I got there I was greeted by Anita who was super sweet, Mary Jo (amazing) and a few of the assistants.  Everyone was so nice. My assistant Brie came to get me and got me all ready for the doctor. Brie was great! I told her how scared I was and she assured me I was in great hands. She did not lie. Dr. Covington was the best. She was personable, kind, fun, and just the best at what she does. Needless to say today is the day after my procedure and I can't tell I had anything done.

115158672734897726347,1505332129494,"I started our renovation project thinking the big box stores would be cheapest for cabinets. Joanna Gaines always has a limited cabinet budget, so ""why not?"" I thought. I went into Kitchen Sales just to look at their selection of countertops and was sweetly approached by Tina, who offered assistance with my project. I told her we were going with Lowes because we didn't have a huge cabinet budget. Tina kindly told me that Kitchen Sales also does lower budget renovations. She quickly put together a quote based on the dimensions and layout I provided her. Her quote was $3000 less than our ""cheap"" cabinets from Lowes. AND the cabinets from Kitchen Sales were real wood, not just laminate covered particle board. Kitchen Sales was also $500 cheaper than the lowest price cabinets at Knox Rail Salvage, which totally won my husband over. Tina came to our home to do a final measure and was just the kindest person to work with. She didn't mind that our house is 60 years old or that our kitchen was a perpetual ""construction zone"". She didn't mind that we had a tiny budget or that the project wasn't huge. She treated us with kindness and attention to detail as if our cabinet budget was $20k+.
The cabinets arrived promptly to the warehouse and they held them a week to reduce any crowding before our contractor started. The delivery guys were fast, careful and efficient in loading/stacking the cabinets in our home.
I HIGHLY recommend working this company. All the staff were kind and helpful.
As an aside, I walked into Dixie Kitchens and was not even acknowledged after walking around for 15 minutes. So glad I kept looking and found Kitchen Sales!",,,0x885c1646ac311e89:0x38d6052b7efdb1a

I got pregnant in March and in July my boyfriend and I wanted to move out early as possible..on the lease contract  it does state that ""if any reason before your lease leaving you'll have to pay 1,000."" But here were the reasons WHY WE WANTED TO LEAVE BADLY. Constant gunshot near by the apartment or in the complex. We would see young kids (they don't live there) coming here just hanging out late mind you they have a gate, but it's not working. We also see a lot of police patrol cars there in the apartment..we heard the last manager was taking money orders (he got caught) my boyfriend told me to get ready to pack and not to tell anyone. We left in July quietly..after few weeks past we went back and saw a notice on the door stating there was a court date because we did not give them a notice. my boyfriend went to court and the judge said he'll need to pay 1,000 within a month..and obviously I didn't pay a dime! Why should we? The air conditioner didn't work and the stove had four but only ONE worked.. so update its been 3 years past and nothing happened to us. I am glad we didn't give them 1,000. Also the rooms can be unlocked by using a simple car keys or any small object it can be unlocked! Im not sure about the front door never tried but if you got robbed inside and locked the room they can easily unlock the door.

The gate hasn't worked in years, so it's not a gated community. They don't stay on top of keeping the dumpster taken care of, so it's trash everywhere, and of course that means raccoons and other wild animals. I had issues with nats from nearly day one because of the trash adjacent to my unit. And be ready to be your own pest control because there are plenty of bugs and lizards sharing the place with you. Maintenance request? Girl bye. They won't come fix it unless you threaten to call code enforcement. The only way you'll hear from the people at the leasing office is if you don't pay rent.

101477075330277742787,1603387303582,"Resident 2017 - 2020.

The appliances here are pretty cheap and break often in some way or another. Maintenance, which is now contracted I believe, is no longer reliable or trustworthy as they often don't fix issues and blame the resident for not fixing / preventing the issues.

Some of these issues include A/C malfunction (common), dishwasher literally detaching from its framing within the counter, fire alarm malfunction, exterior grime build-up outside front doors due to the current trash pick-up system, bugs including spiders, centipedes, and silverfish, and most recently, mold. Management’s response to the mold issue was to install industrial dehumidifiers within each unit above the washer / dryer and carve a ventilation hole above each bedroom door to allow circulation. For all the units, mold or not, there is now no soundproofing whatsoever.

There is no animal ""park"" per se, but there are designated grassy areas for your pets, with waste bags and bins. Of course, not everyone here uses them. This is a pretty good-sized complex for a small or mid-sized animal. Animals require a flat fee + monthly charge.

They call it “trash valet”, which sounds nice, but really, they just give you a trash bin that sits in front of your door and someone comes to collect it at 8pm most nights. This means there’s garbage constantly sitting in front of most doors. This is optional, and you don’t have to use it. Either way, you are required to pay for the convenience.

________
Pros:

Very close to campus. (I walked every day)

The gym, attached to the office, is quite lovely.

Mail is well organized and accessible by the office 24/7.

Security every night. (They don’t really pay much attention)

Spacious balcony.

Large kitchen – good for entertaining.

Washer / dryer included.

TV included in the common area.

There is wifi, but it could be better and not crash so much.

Each bedroom comes with furniture, kitchenette, two closets, and private bathroom.

Cons:

As much as I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, current EMQ management is new at what they do, and they don’t do it very well compared to the management in prior years.

To my knowledge, there is no longer a dedicated maintenance staff. Maintenance is unreliable and lackluster.

Cheap appliances – but the refrigerator in the common area is great.

No soundproofing. As someone who works from home, I don’t want to hear my roommates clashing around in the common area, but due to the newly installed ventilation, it’s like your door is cracked open at all times.

Grimy, nasty staircases leading to your front door. They have not been cleaned in almost 2 years. The trash valet system means you walk through other people’s garbage if you live on the third floor.

________
Essentially, the extra money you pay to live here is for the conveniences within your bedroom. If you don’t plan to work from home, or stay at EMQ every night of the week, I would not recommend staying here over another complex. If you’re like me and you have reasonably high expectations for the priciest “student-living” apartment complex in Murfreesboro, I also would not recommend that you stay here. If you don’t care about any of the cons, you’ll survive just fine.","Hey Erick! Thank you for your review. We think you're great and would love to talk with you to get more detail about your review.

Also the parking system or the way how it works is really the worst ever. They require any visitors to have a tag or there car will be towed and they only give to the resident one parking permit for one visitor only and what if someone have three or four friends wanna meet?!

And on overages.. well when people run the dishwasher multiple times a day that uses alot of water and electricity so there will be overages.

As you know from the times that we have spoke, my door is always open to hearing any concerns that you may have. We have several ongoing projects this Summer that we look forward to finishing to provide additional enjoyment for the residents and upgrading the amenity areas. Pest control is always available for the residents on a weekly basis. Of course, I'm always happy to discuss any specific concerns with you, please just let me know if there is a time that you would like to come in to my office.

Thank you,

100638564745005792713,1507384679813,"Moved here in August, the back porch had a birds nest and covered in pigeon feces. Put on the move-in inspection report the condition of the porch. Spoke to Tammy about it also. Was told in August by one of the maintenance men that they would be out soon to pressure wash( I would think this should of been done before anyone moved in!). Still has not been cleaned. Spoke to Tammy in the office again in August, was told they would get to it soon because they had to get a new pressure washer. Still has not been cleaned. On September 7th, they pressure washed the breezeway, not my porch. Asked the maintence guy why he did not pressure wash the porch since they knew about it. He promised he would be by the next day (Sept 8) by 1pm to clean the porch. Still has not been cleaned!

Stopped by the office again last week and spoke with Tammy about the porch and another work order that was not completed. She told me she would put in another work order. Still has not been cleaned. I have since knocked down the nest and tried to sweep as much of the feces of the floor of the porch as I can. I cannot let my children play on the porch area or put any outside furniture until this is finushed. Going on 3 months now, STILL NOT DONE. Wish I could post pictures of what it looked like on the porch when I moved in, it was filthy!

UPDATE: 10/7/17 Not able to make repeat visits to the office about this matter. Cleaned most of the area myself with soapy water, wash cloth and sponge mop/broom.","Hi Michelle-

Thank you for your review! I apologize that your issue with your porch has not been resolved yet. I am going to look into this for you to get it resolved.

If you could contact me directly, I would love to speak to you so that we get you taken care of.

115875504323816805971,1489482075825,"This review is about the massage therapy division. I have come here several times and never had an issue. This particular time I requested two services with a 'professional'. My appointment was at 11:30am. I showed up at 11:10 just in case there was paper work again (there was). A few minites after doing the paper work the therapist came out and adv she would be with me in a moment she was just setting up (mind you it was already after the time my appointment was supposed to have started). I waited another ten minutes, a total of 15 minutes after I was supposed to have started my appointment.  I spoke to the receptionist and she stated, ""She's just setting up, give her a minute"". This angered me a little as we all know you pay for the length if time for your session. I stated this to the receptionist who returned with, ""I will make sure she goes over your time to take care of you"". This was not possible as I had an appointment following my treatments. The receptionist asked me to sit back down and then went to speak to the therapist who met her at the top of the hallway where I heard the receptionist say, ""She's complaining"". I could see the disdain on the therapist's face as we walked to the back. We get in the room and she asked me what areas I had as concern. I have had massages before so I know this is a common question however having already been upset with her wasting my time I felt like this was again a waste of my time as I already filled out the paperwork staying what the issue was which she clearly didn't read. I told her again what my issue was and she asked me to disrobe and get under the sheets as she left. I got under and immediately saw spots on the cover of the head rest. I pointed these out to the therapist  who made an excuse and assured me it was clean. She then turned it on the other side and that side was even worse. I then requested a new one and she left to get it and I got dressed and got a refund. I will gladly pay more money for simple customer service.",,,0x8864d8eb6b967151:0x9587d4275abc566a

Needless to say, we moved to a much better situation. Upon move-out was charged entire deposit and then some... and I'm certain the unit was left cleaner than when we initially moved in. So, just closing the loop here and returning the favor. Consider yourself truthfully informed.","We are disappointed to hear that you did not have a more positive experience during your stay at Miller Creek at Germantown. While it is never our intention to assess cleaning/damage charges upon a residents departure, sometimes the incurred cost to restore an apartment home to its original condition requires us to do so.  When such a case arises, we do make every effort to communicate all final charges in writing to the address provided at the time of move out.  This statement outlines what the charges were for and is delivered within 10 days of departure. If there is something that you don't agree with or understand, I would love an opportunity to discuss this matter further with you.

117000325586624289949,1452534869338,"DO NOT MOVE TO MILLER CREEK.  Don't be fooled by the ""promises"" of an onsite security guard, or a ""secure"" gated entrance.  There is no security guard, and the gated entrance is broken (stuck open) for 11 months out of the year.

Lived here for 18 months, and had a wheel stolen off of my brand new Dodge Charger in the middle of the night (April 2015).  The manager, Eric, refused to acknowledge any security issues at Miller Creek and didn't show any remorse in the fact that my wife and I no longer felt secure at his establishment.  Not to mention, two weeks after he told me MC had no problems with security, two more vehicles were hit where they busted out the windows and stole all four tires.  And since, there have been numerous break ins not only to vehicles, but to the apartments themselves.

Two trucks were broken into TODAY (01/11/2016), and one of those had all four tires stolen.  Don't think this is a past issue of these apartments.  These apartments are targeted by thieves and management refuses to do anything about it.

Ask any resident about their experience at Miller Creek before even considering living here.",,,0x887f99e532211ce1:0xd3b7a0f93eede903
108693970402362652351,1537199794505,"Fees on top of your rent (nonnegotiable):

Pest control: $5.00
Alarm Monitoring: $25.00
Valet Trash: $22.00
Sewer: $4.63
Storm Water: $5:61
Garage: Depends (call front office)

It rounds out to be $75 additional to your base rent. This will not include MLGW which is $100 a month in a 1 bedroom.

Overall the apartment complex is quiet & the pool & grilling area is always clean. There is a place to wash your vehicle if your into that. You will see complaints about the gate being always broken which is true. (People can't stop tearing it up) If you have kids you will be zoned for Germantown. Which is a plus.

The Apartments does have weekly events from wine tastings, jewelry sales to food trucks. Easy access to the highway from Forrest Hill Irene.

116474308265250966656,1463488988702,"Miller Creek Crossing became our home going on nearly a year now. We’re a young (well, nearly 40) couple with a bright and energetic four year (nearly five) old boy. We moved here across State lines from Alabama and spent a great deal of time living out of an Extended Stay hotel while I went to work everyday and my Wife canvassed the entire Memphis/Shelby County area looking for the perfect place to stay. After a dozen visits to similar apartment complex and facilities…we choose to hang our hats here at Miller Creek Crossing. In brief, we made that choice based on some of the following aspects of what Miller Creek Crossing had to offer: Compared to most complexes we visited and researched the cleanliness, size and material makeup of the residences was certainly above par when compared to the rest of the apartment inventory the area had to offer at the time. We loved the high ceilings, the large beautiful porch (we live on a corner unit) and the kitchen above all…the kitchen was heads and tails better than anything else the competition had. Quite frankly I was a little stressed in beginning because in the back of my mind I thought what if upon moving into our apartment, it would not be the same quality as the ‘demo’ unit we’d seen. The very ‘demo’ unit that had ‘sold us’ on the ‘move in’ to Miller Creek. Thankfully, to my surprise and relief, the apartment we arrived at, on moving day, was as close to a spitting image of the demo unit as we could ask for. It’s always nice to get what you paid for, especially since it’s so common these days to get swindled into end products that are nothing like the product as advertised. Especially when moving into a new apartment complex. Having that trust solidified from day one goes a long way in terms to one’s family overall happiness. After all, where your family live is not only one of the top three expenses for the modern American family, but it also helps shape us and our children. It’s amazing the effect one’s everyday environment can have upon them, their lifestyle and the quality of life that’s provided for their family. So, as far as being sold on a false bill of goods? Not the case here. Putting everything on the table, though. There were a couple of setbacks that did take us by surprise and that we were not to entirely thrilled about. These setbacks had nothing to do with the staff at Miller Creek Crossing. We were told, from many sources, that his was ‘in’ the Germantown School district. (Obviously, very important to us having a four year old just about to enter the school system.) If you’re taking notes…IT IS ‘NOT’ in the Germantown School District. It’s actually just across the line…a ‘line’ that is literally across the across the street…a ‘line’ that now seemingly seems to mock and tease me as I drive past it everyday. So, in terms of being upset over the misinformation…in the end the only people we can blame is ourselves. Now moving on from that sob story, if you’re reading this review right now…then mark yourself as ‘being informed’, and ‘in the know’ in regards to the location of the Germantown School District. You are NOT in it. You can thank me later. You’re welcome. On a different note…some think the rent here’s a little too high. We actually never did, when we moved here, because it fit perfectly within our budget. Well, it fit perfectly within our budget…until I found out I’d have to pay for Private School. Did I mention the snafu about finding out that we were not in the Germantown School District? On a closing note. I know they work hard here everyday at Miller Creek Crossing to keep this a ‘Leading Property’ in terms of quality, lifestyle and security…we really do enjoy living here. The staff, the fellow tenants, the facilities and all the new security enhancements they’ve been working on have been wonderful. So…please keep working hard Miller Creek Crossing, and I’ll reciprocate by also working hard…after all, Private School is expensive in Germantown!",,,0x887f99e532211ce1:0xd3b7a0f93eede903

115056391696196210506,1607043544133,"So, where do I begin..I unfortunately got scammed on Craigslist renting what I thought was a cabin that existed in Sevierville only to drive up and realize that nothing existed at all. I was scared, angry, and left without a place to stay for three nights...this was also during the high season in the Smokies. While I was figuring out my next move, I luckily met a gentleman who put me in touch with this company. By the grace of God, they had a tiny cabin that was perfect for me for exactly the same price that I thought I would be paying for the non- existent cabin. I immediately booked it and drove to their site to grab keys, paperwork, etc. I cannot tell you after going through an experience like that, how wonderful it was to have an established company to work with which had someone who could meet me and talk over instructions on how to get it the property, etc.

Once at the cabin, it was at the perfect location and felt safe for me as I was by myself. It actually had two rooms, one of which had a pool table; jacuzzi, and beautiful deck to watch the sunset. It was tucked away at the back of a road and fairly secluded. I have to think that this was somehow a gift from God because there were absolutely no other cabins available and I'm so, so appreciative of this company for having something for me and making the process as seamless as possible given the terrible experience I had coming into the Smokies. I will forever be grateful ❤️",,,0x885bff692917a409:0x854e5331a05f348a

The second our lease is up we are gone. We have had the worst time here. There is not enough parking for any of the tenants and now they have decided to tow those who park on the fence when there is no parking. We find it to be very unsafe for our family. The management is well I would never say great nor fine maybe lower then fine. The biggest issue is that they care about the money and that's about it.

106584191657548740035,1528155523687,"There is feeling good and there is feeling better.
Any massage feels good. But I was wanting to feel better. After several sessions with one of masseuse I was randomly assigned with Amanda. It hurt but she asked me what was bothering me and really went after it. And it hurt.. that was 3 months ago and I haven't had a sore morning since. Which means I no longer let out the 80 year old man groan when getting out of bed - I feel great and still feel great. No idea what she did, and it will probably upset Massagr Envy bosses knowing I don't need as many massage appointments - but I personally thank her for all she did. And the next time my back goes wacko, I know exactly where I am going and who I am asking for.  Thank you so much. Still feeling great months later.  I called the other day asking if the same therapist who originally helped me was there, but they weren't . The service I recieved by the suggested massage person was good, but nowhere near the previous massouse. I might recommend offering consistent training to your personnel to avoid letting customers feel short changed.  Just a tip, as I probibly won't be coming back.

106624176682972755754,1533974370886,"very limited gel colors!

It makes me so sad to post this the business is broken. I offered to take an appointment that was another customer's cancellation, on short notice. I was told it was on friday via phone and happily marked my calendar... then received a call on the day prior stating I would be charged for missing my appointment... someone else's appointment! I was told I should have known the appointment was on a different day than i was initially told based off an email confirmation. I never signed up to receive email or text as primary confirmation... yet starting this week the salon decided that how they should start contacting me? If you have a record of calling your customers with a confirmation 24hrs before, that's what they will come to expect.

A misunderstanding that could have been solved by making a confirmation call, as specified in customer my file... resulted in a lost & hurt customer.
For 2 years I was a loyal customer here, always booking in advance. I've paid full cancelation fees when it was my goof with no grief... my fault, not theirs.

The salon runs a bad business, they hire almost entirely apprenticeship pay level nail artists, despite their experience & force their artists to buy their own colors and nail art supplies out of pocket. Shame on the the owner of this place for taking advantage of their employees & throwing away happy customer's like yesterdays trash.

Say what they want but the staff roll-over here speaks for itself. I definitely understand the means girls club reputation.","Hi Tonneli,Thanks for sharing your concerns. We do stock over 100 colors of polish in Gel and Lacquer options and are constantly updating our colors as new collections launch. I apologize that we didn’t meet your expectations on our color selections. As for your appointment today... it was me who called you on August 2nd to fill the availability you had been waiting on for Thursday August 9th. Our records show that you received the following confirmation emails and text messages to all of points of contact that you provided us with( both a cell number and email address):8/8 at 7:04PM- Text message delivered for night before reminder8/7 at 9:06AM- Email delivered, Confirmation of appt 48 hours in advance8/7 at 9:05AM- Text message delivered, Confirmation of appt 48 hours in advanceOur system does show that all of these correspondences were received by you and confirmed via text message the night of August 7th from your mobile number. We have had you opted in to receive text and email reminders since December 2017.  The only time we make the confirmation calls is when a guest hasn’t confirmed via text or email, but you had on the night of August 7th according to our system records. We have always valued you as a customer but unfortunately after this mornings No-Show appt, our system automatically restricted you as we do have the following history of you cancelling after our 24 hour cancellation policy within the last year:8/11/2017- Cancellation after 24 hours11/29/2017 - Cancellation after 24 hours 2/24/2018 - Cancellation after 24 hoursIn addition to those cancellations listed above there was an additional 6 cancellations that fell just outside of the 24 hour cancellation policy. After 3 occurrences of an “after 24 hour cancellation” and now a “no-show” our system is set up to protect our service providers and restricts these client profiles.  I understand that this upsets you, but I do have an obligation to protect my service providers time. You are welcome to walk-in as a manicure guest and we’d love to take care of you, but unfortunately I can not reserve any future appointments for you as your profile is now restricted. I also want to clarify, all of our nails techs on staff have a minimum of 6 years of experience. One has 6 years, one has 15 years and another has just over 20 years. We also do provide many nail art supplies as well as their professional product for use, and paid continuing education for our service providers. Our techs are responsible for just their own tools, as they each prefer to use their own. We actually have very little staff roll-over, and in most cases lose our valued team members due to military relocations, as many of our team members are military spouses.I greatly value each member of my team as much as I value my own family and I care a great deal for all of our guests, including you. I’m sorry you are unhappy with us, but I do wish you the best moving forward. - Aaron W., Spa Director",1534970757318.0,0x548f8b587877fd71:0x27322ca0f967935b

It was very sudden and devastating for me.  I have never had an ear issue in my life. I saw two doctors early on and was finally referred to another ENT (not Dr. Ummat). After some treatment with that ENT,  I decided to see Dr. Ummat for a second opinion.  One word he is AMAZING! He not only took the time to listen to me, but he explained my issue very thoroughly to me.  He put me at ease and for the first time in 2 months I felt better and somewhat optimistic. He has recommended some additional tests which make sense and I will continue with him for my follow-up care. I also want to acknowledge his wonderful staff. When I first scheduled my appointment I had a very understanding and compassionate receptionist schedule my appointment.  Dr. Ummat's nurse who brought me back today, Wow! She was so friendly and very understanding.  She genuinely made me feel that my issue was important and that Dr. Ummat was the best.  My only regret is,  I wish that I had seen Dr. Ummat first. It is true Dr. Ummat is the Best!  Thank you to Dr. Ummat and his staff (you truly care about your patients).",,,0x5490132c759c4ab3:0x616c9e9cf8dd0ba0

115599449878095232406,1467826865931,"I was so stupid to think that this place could help my severe acne. My insurance didn't cover most dermatologists so I decided to take a different route and try Skin & Laser. I came in with an open mind and limited amount of money I could spend due to my unemployment. Dr. lins sister, Avon, did my consultation and immediately recommended I do a photogenic laser treatment that ""should"" help clear my acne. The bad news is that each treatment was around $550 and I had to do it 3 times! She also talked me in to some very expensive creams and acne pills which was supposed to help my acne. Desperate and depressed I agreed really putting my trust and time with these people. After trying the creams and doing the laser treatment for 2 months I saw no improvement in fact my acne got worse! I was also running out of money and could no longer afford to waste it all so quickly. Finally I had enough and called them to tell them how disappointed I was and how I was going to seek professional help. They replied with a simple, ""Ok great, if you ever need to come back call us again"". That's it...no sympathy or solution to have me come back. It's like they gave up on me and didn't care anymore. I really felt like I had been stolen from and made a fool. Luckily I called my insurance and found a dermatologist that accepted my insurance. Please if you are struggling with severe acne and seek help in clearing it do NOT go to Skin & Laser! These people do know some things about acne but they are not professionals. They expect these really expensive treatments to work and when they don't they are dumbfounded not knowing what to do except to tell you to be patient and keep doing it. They are theifs and uncaring! Every time I went in there they would always forget my name and wouldn't even have the decency to call me when I was at home and see how everything was it how my acne was doing.

Was annoying and I really was excited to see the skill described in certain reviews. Sorry about the 2 star, but it was the day my mom died and I was going to see her one last time before she died and that haircut meant something to me because of that. Wish I did get it cut there. If I do and is a great experience I will change rating and reflect experience in my new words. I had to beg 4 places before the fifth place squeezed it in so I could say bye to my mom looking decent. 🙏","There is no record of anyone by this name being served at The Art of Hair, even recently.  This person first posted a negative review five months ago, to which I replied that I had never served a person by this name.  Six days ago, the review was  modified to state what  it shows now.  In nearly 30 years of service, I have never told a potential client that they are a ""waste of time,"" or that ""it's below me."" If I did something like that, my business would fail.  People who know me understand that I am a compassionate  and caring person.  I run an appointment only salon (a sign is posted at the front entrance that reads ""Service by appointment only"")  and I can't generally do walk-in service when my schedule is usually full.  I typically have to decline walk-in requests, which I always do professionally, offering my business card for future reference.  This is typical in my industry unless shops specifically cater to walk-in clients. To which I say there is always Supercuts for people who need immediate help.  I would never intentionally insult a grieving person and have always been supportive of people's feelings.  This review is blatantly false and vindictive, the conversation alleged never took place, and I don't even know who it is.  How in the world does a person ""call in for an appointment"" and then be ""declined at the door.""  Makes no sense.  I trust the general public will see through this salacious post and will know that I have nothing to apologize for.  I stand by my professional character.  I guess some people feel entitled to whatever they want whenever they want it.  I hope never to be the kind of person that Anthony Kalnins falsely presents here.",1564988489945.0,0x5495af40b74dc189:0x4988484c5c96a5d3

The building is great for views, and maintenance and services are prompt.

Cons:
Thin walls: Voice travels between apartments
Lot of noise from ambulances and fire engines
Logic behind move out charges.

I am leaving these details about the move-out process so that fellow tenants are aware of the issues.

I had bad experience with the move-out process. I kept my apartment is really good condition, and didn't use any nails or drill holes on the walls, and when I moved out, the paint and the walls were in really good condition.

After moving out, I chose to be present at the time of inspection. First, they gave me a Sunday appointment. When I got there, they said they don't do move-out inspections on Sunday and gave me a Monday 9 AM appointment. When I got there on Monday morning, the maintenance supervisor said they have already done the inspection, and didn't find any damages or issues. He said that we will paint the apartment, because ""it's standard, and that's what we do for all apartments in this building"". I trusted Nik and didn't argue about this.

Later, I read the WA state tenant rights and realized that they can't charge me for paint, giving this reason, and tenant can only be charged if the damage is beyond normal wear and tear.

I tried to dispute the charges with greystar but got these responses:
1) We disagree with you on the wall damage and we don't need to provide you any proof or pics for it because we are not obligated to do so.
2) You should have been present at move-out inspection.

Now, I am not a lawyer, and neither I have enough time on my hands to hire a lawyer and drag this, nor I am going to sweat over this amount, but I was expecting some logical and decent conversation with greystar instead of being given standard answers which basically mean ""Screw you for not covering all your bases"".

The amount of paint fee and cleaning fee itself is very reasonable, but it was more of an issue of principal for me. I wouldn't be leaving 1 star rating despite the charges if people from greystar were not rude. In the end they just said, what are you going to do. True words. So, I'll just leave this review here.","Hi Abhinav,   Thank you for reaching out and leaving us this feedback!

117007284080181997704,1543168328270,"My two friends and I got off work on a Saturday and called in to see if they could fit us in for nail service. We were told absolutely, so we arrived about 4:30pm. We had reservations that evening in Tacoma at 7pm and assumed we had plenty of time. I was way past due for a fill and had a couple acrylics missing, so the technicians decided to remove them all and put on a fresh set. The lady who reapplied my acrylic took absolutely FOREVER, and she applied it so thick that I felt like I had legitimate eagle talons. After about an hour and a half of her applying and shaping my acrylic I was passed off to a different technician. This lady then spent another 35 minutes hand filing the thickness of the acrylic down by about 50%. Finally I had to tell them to cash me out because we were extremely late for our reservation. The lady tried to tell me she could ""paint nails real quick, takes no time."" Umm, no. Everything at this salon apparently takes inhumanely long and I had no more time to waste. So now I have unfinished, fleshy colored acrylics that are square and not oval like I repeatedly asked for. I was then charged $34 for removal of a couple nails and an unfinished, unpainted set of acrylics. My normal nail salon charges me $25 for a full set, in the shape I requested, fully painted with shellac, and in less than half the time I spent at Best Nails. One of our friends had to stay behind because despite the fact we had been at the salon for two hours her tips had only just been applied. She ended up giving the employees a piece of her mind so they offered us free service for our next visit, but I still will not be back. I'll be going somewhere else this afternoon to have shellac applied to my nails like I thought I would have done yesterday with my new set. I would stay away from this place unless you have completely cleared your schedule for the day only to have your nails half done.",,,0x549041fde2fdd129:0x7e548fdb3716c590

110399513107329545298,1470592958783,I wouldn't recommend this place because when I went to get shellac nails there the lady seemed impersonal. She didn't ask me what I wanted done but instead proceeded to soak my nails. I don't mind the lack of small talk I'm all about result and not even a week later my nails started chipping. Also she didn't get the whole nail painted and was rubbing off the nail polish with remover but I had a hang nail so that hurt.

I would be getting my nails done.) After my pedicure complete with bloody toe and lopsided toenails.... I explained what shape and length I wanted my nails... And Got Neither... Then after an hour and 45 minutes shes finally done filing and keeps insisting I need gel topcoat on my White tip Acrylic nails... I guess to add that thickness to their already short squaty appearance. So after 2 HOURS and 20 min... She tells me my grand total (to limp out on my still profusely Bleeding Toe, nails looking worse than when I got there) IS $60!!!!!!!!  Yes. When you can literally see out the window the place across the street has manis for $10 and pedis for $12! Luckily for them, I was in a hurry to get back to Portland, where they value their customers, but I will NEVER COME BACK, and want to make sure I warn others as well. If you look at the station in front of the door, my Blood Stain will be there Im sure because they ignored it like it happens all the time... Didnt even sanitize her tools...

It is quite expensive here and for the service I got I was totally disappointed. My nails were not filed evenly at all, the cuticles were not trimmed properly, dead skin peel was not cut completely. I asked for gel polish. At the end she said you are good to go and my nails looked like craters of the moon. I had to ask to get it fixed.

Neutral: The rent is high but that's true of most places around here nowadays.
Cons: You will be charged for EVERYTHING. And it starts to build up really quickly. The office people seem to hate their job and take it out on residents.

113219534935967578419,1450318636258,"The first year that I was here (2012-13) was fantastic...until it was time to renew the lease and we were priced out of our 3 bedroom apartment as the rent went up over $300 per month!

Despite the unexpectedly high rent increase I decided to stay in the complex, and down size to a 2 bedroom. This is when it got ugly and, in retrospect, I should have just left then. The leasing agent I was working with was super sweet and polite but failed to reserve the apartment we agreed upon not once, but TWICE. Each time we had to rush to find another available apartment. As a result, I ended up paying an extra month's rent in the overpriced 3 bedroom while I waited for a 2 bedroom to open up. In fairness to management, they did agree to give me that month at the original rate since it was their error(s) that caused it.

In the end, the only apartment left was a 2 bedroom that is nearly as expensive as the original three bedroom. I also had to pay $1200 to replace the carpet in the old apartment due to my former roommates' dog. As far as I can tell from previous reviews and from what I've heard from other residents, it's common practice for this complex to charge pet owners to replace the carpet, whether there was in fact damage or not. It also doesn't matter that you've put a security AND pet deposit down. Pet owners should expect a $1200 bill after move out. I guess that, the pet deposit, and the pet rent are all the price you pay for living in a ""pet friendly"" community.

The biggest mistake I made was renewing my lease here in 2014, rather than finding some place cheaper in the city. Yes, you read that right. Before I decided to stay, I found houses for rent in nice neighborhoods in Seattle for as much as $500 less than I pay here.

Other cons:
- It is nowhere as nice on the inside as it looks on the outside
- Forced to use the concierge trash service, which does not pick up Friday or Saturday
- Monthly admin and upkeep fees are high,and expect dog poo in the yard for weeks
- If you don't have an assigned parking spot, expect to walk 1/4 mile to your apartment
- Smoking is being banned on the premises so smokers will need to leave the grounds to smoke
- Every few months, there's a rash of car break ins
- Once per year, an email goes out warning to keep animals off the grass due to the toxic chemicals they use to treat it

Pros:
- It is relatively quiet
- Close proximity to the expressway and easy bus access (if you're going into the city)
- Shopping nearby
- Two outdoor pools
- BBQ area that you can actually use if you go early or late enough to grab a grill
- Two small fitness centers",Thanks for bringing this concern to our attention. It is our goal to treat everyone respectfully and to have loyal residents.

108752209909128829304,1528327201253,"I hear birds everyday. Occasionally, I hear coyotes. The only time I hear neighbors is when we're off to work around 7am and when we return home around 5pm. My kids feel safe; they play with their friends at the playground. We used the indoor heated pool all winter long. We play racquetball once a week in the indoor court. Once, I smelled a substance; the next day there were signs on the door from management describing what we all signed our names to. Super fast; problem gone.

My closet door came off the rails; I notified management using the portal and Boom! Fixed.

The flip side: is there dog droppings on the grass? Sometimes, because dogs do that and sometimes dog owners forget. And there's acres of grass. It's gorgeous here. There's a stunning nature walk that goes right through the complex.

Do they raise the rent every year? Yes, and I'm grateful. The people who live here pay for the privilege to live in such a clean, quiet, and new community. It's a high standard and they maintain that standard. There are much more expensive apartments, and there are less expensive.

Do you hear the freeways? Yes, and it's awesome because the commute time to downtown Seattle at 6:00am is 20 minutes. It doesn't take 10 minutes to get to the freeway.

Are there other people who live here? Who take the parking spaces? Who occasionally forget their dogs' droppings? Who don't say 'hi,' and who come from other countries? Definitely. Just like my last home that cost $825,000, and after 3 months I had to pay $65,000 for a cinder block fence.

I've been with Greystar for 4 years. It's better than home ownership because they fix everything, they keep everything clean and working, and they screen everyone who lives here. You can't do that when you buy a home. The office staff have a difficult job in trying to appease the owners and maintain 500 happy families.

So read the reviews. The bad reviews are from people who might not have had much apartment experience, I wonder if they've owned a home. The good reviews are from people who might have a bit more experience in that regard. I choose to live in an apartment in Puget Sound. Finding a complex that feels like home in many respects is a challenge. So when I moved from Mill Creek to Avana522 I did so intentionally. Because Greystar has created a community that I call home at Avana522.","Hi Dale,  We are so happy YOU chose to live with us!

105914676873962021335,1555642940914,"Absolutely horrible and incompetent people working at the front office. Got nickled and dimed for every little thing. Originally we had called to look for a 2 bedroom apartment and we were told there was one available for showing which was within our price range. My roommate and I thought that was great, so we hadscheduled a viewing only to arrive to the complex saying that there wasn't a place available in the time frame we needed it. Instead it would have to be a couple weeks earlier for a move in then originally planned. Oh, and by the way, the 12 month lease is no longer available.  I was confused as to why that wouldnt be an option anymore, but anyways we decided to go ahead the look at the different unit that was available.  When we came back to Avana with our choice to move forward we were told that the 13 month lease was not available.  Only the 14 month because, now get this, too many people would be moving out that month after our lease would end. Why would that impact us??? Moving forward, cars were being broken into, mailboxes and packages would go missing, and so and so forth. Although they do have a ""secure"" package room, the iPad to check in for your package would shut down where you couldn't get your package at your convenience.  You're required to pay into a trash service where sometimes they would miss picking up your garbage.  You are required to put down a deposit prior to you moving in, but dont even think you'll see a single cent of that deposit back after you move out. Between my roommate and I, we put down 750 ($250 ea deposit, plus $250 pet). When we moved out we cleaned EVERYTHING thoroughly and made sure the little holes were patched up and yet apparently painting the walls cost $100, patching the walls cost another $75, carpet cleaning $103, general apartment cleaning $115. So, it was as if we shouldn't have even bothered cleaning as we weren't going to get anything back. We had a balance due for the last utilities bill (runs a month behind) but we couldn't pay that online as the day you move out they immediately closed the portal. They couldnt even bother to assist. In fact it was rather difficult to get a hold of anyone when attempting to call them. When you do make it to the office, the ladies there are so ridiculous and incapable of actually doing their job that you might as well be talking to the wall. It would be more entertaining! Honestly, this apartment with the thin walls (you could actually hear our upstairs neighbors peeing and puking, thats how ridiculously thin they were) and over-priced units, we really shouldn't have signed with this complex.  I wish I was able to give Avana 522 a big fat 0. I normally don't write reviews as I have better things to do, but living at this place has made that much of a negative impact that I hope others do their diligent research before signing on. Not worth the time, money, or hassle.  You'll thank me.","Hi Deepa, thank you for your feedback. We regret to hear that your experience with us was not a more positive one.

115310928368701502663,1488577146304,"My family and I have been living here for about a week and if your thinking about moving here.. well don't! These people are LIARS! Just run the other way. We had such a terrible experience from the start. First off u have to pay $250 when you initially start the application process which is non refundable. We were told it's to save the apartment u want. My husband got a new job at the time and it took us longer for his owner to send an acceptance letter to Avana. When Avana finally received it they said they already leased the fully updated apartment because we didn't have that letter to them within 72hrs.. we were never told we had a deadline. So what's the point of the $250 deposit?  The office people.. don't even get me started on them!
Then they found us another top floor apartment and we were told it was fully updated. Once we signed the lease and moved in it was not the fully updated apartment. Crappy white cabinets that are falling apart NOT TO MENTION they just painted and replaced the carpeting with faux hardwood floors and the place wasn't cleaned after. White dust all over the floors and counters. Poop on the toilet and the first time I went to use the toilet it didn't even flush and leaked water. My husband has the worst allergies in this apartment and my 3 month old I stay at home with also sneezes all the time. And now our washing machine is leaking water!!! I feel so cheated by this place and very unhappy. After I cleaned the apartment they offered us to clean it and gave us a Starbucks gift card lol. Great start to a one year long ass lease. Wish we moved in somewhere else.","Hello Kimberly, I am sorry you were unable to secure the original apartment you were seeking.

All sorts of deposits come up only during the signing part (not sure if that's their tactics or employees don't know how much it costs to sign a lease with them or what the deposits are in the beginning). We were told that it would be free to sign because of corporate agreements, then all of a sudden we had to put $3000 in various fees, which was not communicated in the beginning. After the lease ends, good luck getting deposit back. We got charged for a whole wall painting (lease said that they charge $5 per whole...), counter replacement (which was identified by the employee as wear and tear and we shouldn't worry)... In total over $150 dollars for wrongful charges. Would not recommend.","Hi Agne,   Thank you for taking a moment to share your disappointment with us, we appreciate you bringing light to the cause of your disheartening experience.

112312069274617174133,1487193545103,"Have lived here a little over a year, and I like it.    Some Pros and Cons

Cons first.

- It's Expensive.   But.... It's on the Eastside.   Everything is expensive over here.

- It's definitely 'corporate owned'  If your dog gets barky, or your car is parked wrong, or you do something 'wrong', you get these 'official', somewhat snippy notes.   Again, pretty sure it's the corporate thing.

Pros.

-Great facilities for working out, good dog park, nice campus, and I like the apartments themselves.

-Unlike many of the other reviewers on here, I like the staff quite a bit.  Even though it's a corporate chain, if you are having an issue and you actually go TALK to them, they are reasonable folks and always willing to work with you.   Stephanie the manager is a good example.  Nice gal, and very helpful if you work with her.

-Cool maintenance Staff.   Any time something in or on your apartment isn't working (which doesn't happen too often), they come right out and take care of it.   Francisco in particular is great!

-Mentioned this a little before, but it's a good place if you have a dog (like me).  The campus is big, lots of room to walk, and there is a nice off leash park right on the campus.

Solid place if you want to be on the Eastside.","Thank you Cameron for sharing your thoughts, we really do appreciate it!  Both Stephanie and Francisco are great assets to our team.

110571255877090523430,1597344145488,"I toured this apartment along with Marina+Westlake Steps, Leeward and Mera. I didn't end up signing a lease but I highly recommend checking this place out. I also stayed here for a month when I first moved to the city. I toured with Galfato who is very honest about the building and unit. I really appreciated his recommendations - I specifically asked for a quiet unit under my budget and he suggested this beautiful unit overlooking the courtyard. It was quiet except for the water feature which gave a soft, serene ambient sound.

Pros:
- Beautiful rooftop. You aren't obstructed by the AGC building or Lake Union building
- Great amenities. I like the diversity of workout appliances - rowing machine, free weights and smith machine. Also, like the kayaks and SUPs.
- Units are spacious compared to the ones at Marina
- Lobby was well maintained  (no random packages on the floor)

Cons:
- FOB locks. If you're the type to forget your keys, you'll probably get yourself locked out of the apartment. During office hours, there's somebody at the desk and when I had stayed, they were quick to get me back in.

114872977303196504649,1624409113630,"WARNING. Recently moved in. Seemed like a great idea at first... 30 days in and my kitchen drawers are still broken. Maintenance was informed. Office was informed. I get told they will be here and nothing. Also if you live on the top floor its probably okay. But below someone is a nightmare. Every step above me shakes my entire apartment. That my dog is getting anxiety from it. And you cant have a grill on the large patio. And to top it all off. Parking is horrendous even though the lot is huge. Good luck with your moving truck. Do not move here. No matter how desperate. I only give it two stars because the rent is affordable for Seattle. Or it would be 1 star. If the owner reads this. I would hope you correct the employees working here. They arent ever in the office. And maintenance doesnt show up to fix a few drawers. Which were never properly installed to begin with.

Update: kitchen drawers still not fixed going on 37 days. FHA rights are being violated. Reduced from a sad 2 stars. To a pitiful 1 star. If only I could put a wopping zero.

Second update: : im a licensed pest control operator. This company charges you in rent for pest control. That doesnt get done. I see rats in the day time. Informed them. And they do nothing. Told me ""well let maintenance know"" who isnt legally allowed to do anything! All tenants are paying for malpractice. I've even offered my professional rodent service and was declined. I've even looked at the rodent control stations. They are not labeled to regulation and law. And there is only three stations for around 5 acres of land covered in Ivy. Im am extremely close to contacting my good friend who works for the county and health department.

Third update: I was asked to remove this review. That wont happen. This review is %100 honest truth of my experience living here in only 4 months.

Fourth update: My neighbor who is very quiet has a daughter in kindergarten. And like any child that age. They play outside. She plays with a few other kids as well who live here. Pretty normal if you ask me who grew up in the 90s... However, the property manager seems to have a problem. Someone has called the police on my neighbors for I do not know what. The child is harmless. She plays with my 50lb dog sometimes and is cautious about it. But now the police have been here twice. And the leasing manager has the maintenance watching this little girl. Lord knows I will defend this family in court if needed. I would say the name of the leasing manager. But I feel reading other reviews I do not need to mention her name again.","Aj, we truly appreciate your honest feedback.

116735092935310464086,1624226087774,"I had made an appointment for my single dad friend of twin girls over a week before Father's Day after reading reviews.  Not being from the area, I totally depended on their website and reviews for information, ratings and hopefully actual customers to help me decide.  Nothing was a disappointment!  Great customer service, answered my questions, asked me questions, got off the phone with a 90 minute appointment for the morning before Father's Day as a surprise Father's Day gift.  I arrived in town on Friday night, stopped in to change the time by 15 minutes, super friendly lady met me at the front, easy to change time, felt welcoming, clean and sanitary.
Dropped off my friend for his appointment, another happy welcoming for both of us, paid his visit and left him.  Picked him up with him saying the best massage and felt fantastic, he was very relaxed and rejuvenated, she even found some areas that he didn't even know needed worked on,  not being from the area I highly recommend FS Spa.  I may even make myself an appointment in the future.  Hours are very doable for any working soul.","We are so happy that you chose FS Spa for your fathers day gift.

108264142737187998332,1551004073825,So I saw this little spot and figured I'd give it a try. Prices are competitive...$60 for an hour. The lady that gave me my massage was good. She really focused on working out the knots I had in my shoulder and I liked how she used her forearms and hands to roll them out. It was cool that they mixed a traditional massage with a little traditional Chinese massage as well. It was a different massage but it was good and I felt relaxed after. Worth giving them a try!!,"Thank you Bryce for givin Forever Spring Spa a Try! Yes the massage here is very unique and is focused oriented. Thank you for the kind review.

WOW!
Let's just say I was a bit skeptical. But now I'm a believer. I had deep tissue massage and Angela was amazing. She kneaded and worker just the right spots.

100909062195121825727,1548931274281,"In reply: pedicure was good, but once more customers arrived it was rushed (less attention and time in massage and exfoliation). Great polish job. The accompanying manicure that followed once more customers arrived however was subpar. My two biggest complaints aside from feeling rushed out was:
1- polish had two bubbles in it once finished that were not fixed, and
2- color I selected was running low (didn't seem that low to me) and was told she wouldn't use it (why was it even out then?!). Was told to pick from two other colors brought over to me that weren't remotely like what I selected and hated (I originally wanted a nude pale pink and was given the choice between a cotton candy pink or bright pink?! I had a date so didn't have time to discuss further)! She chose a gel type color from a box behind the manicure tables, but didn't use the accompanying gel top coat from the set. So this made the manicure chip the next day and look terrible by day 3.","Hi, this is Jim Owner of Forever Spring Spa I see that you placed this review in error for we only do massage not Nails!

115192329449567645195,1553982759506,"I wish I could upload a pic with my review because I have a screenshot of this conversation. For some reason it’s not letting me so I will copy and paste. They have the online booking which says time slots are available. Don’t bother because they call or text you to say they’re not.

I reply asking “why does the online booking say this slot is available if it’s not?”

“Because the booking now online only”

Uhhh... is that not what I just did?

“Not online online ”

Huhhh?

Okay now I’m confused. So I respond by saying that it was my first time trying the business out and this happened, that’s not good for business. I get this reply.

“People book online really early not in short time. That’s why you don’t get in”.

Excuse me? I work in a line of business where bookings are made all the time. Some weeks before and some minutes before. So that’s not only an unprofessional thing to say, but also uneducated.

I explained that I had to rearrange my work schedule around to make one of the time slots they showed available on the website. By doing that I lost out on money.

“Booking online not 100%”

I stated that’s fine I will patronize another business. I don’t want to give a place like that my hard earned money. I said I will leave a review explaining my negative booking experience.

“I don’t know how can you review with out getting in first and try it”

Duh! That’s what I tried to do, but you just text me saying you can’t get me in!

I respond “I can review it by saying what just happened. The website says times are available when they’re not. I’m sure that review will help others in my situation. No. People book online all the time. I work in a similar line of business and we get bookings at anytime. Not “short time.” So by you just saying that makes your business look even worse. I will be sure and screenshot your conversation for my review. Thank you and please do not bother me anymore nor respond.

“I have to confirm you booking if we can’t do it we have to let you know first that is what I did. “

First of all, I politely asked you not to respond and continue wasting my time. I’m on the way to the other reputable spa down the street from you. Yeah they charge slightly more, but you get what you pay for. Second, if you have to “confirm the booking” then the website should state that. Maybe I would have called to book rather than do it online.

Long story short, don’t waste your time. These people don’t deserve your money.",Thank you for the review. Because we have walk-in and call-in customers every once in a while a time slot is already booked. In that instance we quickly contact the online customer to reschedule.

Water damaged floor, but hey it was cheap. We had a leak that started in June from the washing machine in the apartment above us (photo attached). They didn't fix it until NOVEMBER! Twice now, we've had issues with the rent payment. The first time, we called in and they basically said, ""oh yeah oops we did get your payment, let me remove that late fee."" This time, they admitted that it was the fault of the auto pay system, but ""can't remove the late fee because there was a previously waived fee on the account"". WHAT?!

Let me explain: I was looking for my first apartment to rent with my family, and at first glance we liked this place. In our naivety, we did not look deeper into the cracks and crevices, missing glaring issues with the unit ( Extreme water damage from previous tenants in both bathrooms required EVERYTHING to be removed, including toilet, bathtub, wall, and flooring).

Despite this, we called and communicated with management regularly, and they went so far as to make sure it will get fixed as soon as possible for the next tenant, as well as the fact that they refunded us and let us break the lease for the rent we already paid as we could not live there safely in those conditions.

Zuzie was extremely polite and helpful throughout the entire ordeal, and I would definitely recommend living here because of the kind and prompt management.

New manager is the worst. She used to not even show up. Dog poop everywhere, especially during winter. People loiter around. It's a mess. Honestly, I've been threatened by my neighbor and been targeted by both the manager and neighbors. I miss the old manager. Kids play in the streets and the playground is near the parking lot.

Put in a work order and they get it done. If they can't do it themselves, they'll hire professionals to do it. If anyone screws up a job, they fix it in a timely manner.

The men who do the landscaping and maintenance are pretty surly, but who wouldn't be with all these people dumping garbage and cigarette butts everywhere? I'm fairly certain that if I had to clean up after these people all day long I'd be pissed off too.

Also, people say you shouldn't have kids in this apartment complex. Why? There's a bunch of kids around here. They do kid things. They have fun. They (usually) don't get in front of cars in the parking lots and they don't get in trouble or damage other people's property. The only thing you have to watch out for is the drug addicts/dealers that think this is still a good spot to hang out. A team effort usually brings them to heel though, and they don't last long.

The water, power, sewage, etc. is all left to the client to pay when you have already paid a hefty fee for first month and last month rent in addition to any charges they have added on for using a credit card. I know it is temporary housing, but throwing down $3,000.00 on a rental should come with the amenities they promised. Then, they tell you if you clean the place and leave it in 'move-in' ready condition, you will not be charged a cleaning fee when they refund your deposit. Which takes two weeks, I might add. However, I was charged a cleaning fee even though I left the place cleaner than it was when I moved in. When I moved in, the tub and sink would not even drain and I fixed that! When I called to ask why I was charged, I got no explanation other than 'The inspector said it needed cleaned'. No notes as to what was wrong, nothing.
These people are horrible. The woman answering the phone had no idea what she was doing and often gave me bad information. She failed to inform me about the alarm in the house and then had no idea what the security code was for it.
If at all possible, take your business elsewhere. You would be better off renting a motel room. At least there you would have the amenities you are promised AND a real cleaning service.",,,0x5499d7ee0c8e11c7:0xe1cda9eb81f83d9d

NOW we are stuck with a second story studio that is disgusting and shouldn't even be habitable for $395 a month and we are stuck in a years lease agreement and they refused to correct the mistake let alone the person who filled out the paperwork won't admit there mistake therefore we are stuck in a place we don't want to live in and out almost $2,000.

His inablity to reform and remodle his units shows he has more money then brains. He sells his units to others so they inturn end up with the problem of completely losing everything they have gained in the first 5 years or more. Jevons expects too much of the people who rent from him and in return he treats them like second rate trash. Note to all you slum lords your time has come you will be investigatd and reported to everyone and everything that will even take this into account maybe being on the news eye of your side for a 6 month investigation would be most fitting. You will be reported.!!! plus the county needs the money and milking you through the health department for unhabitablity I'm sure would put that n ew building project on hold hell those will look like all the others before to long as well.

The work was mediocre at best. Girl was kind and attempted to chat but was hard to understand. The only reason I paid and didn’t fight it was the girl. She tried so hard to please and the manager kept berating her in their language , so I’ve no idea what was said but her response was to bow and apologize to her and then look sheepish at me trying to apologize for the “extra costs”.  The nails were uneven, and my daughter does a better job, she’s never been trained.
BUT that’s not why they get 1 star. They get one star for cause in’s a toe infection, they refusing to refund, even after being asked to come in so they could see the claim. Then tried to blame it on debris left , when I explained it was from ripping my toenail out of my toe. They pushed so hard it was killing me ( not really just hurt like heck) to drain puss. Yeah, that bad. Kept telling it will be fine and heal, just give it time.
Well, no Duh! But I should not have to pay for injury that should never have happened.
One of their customers kept asking what the problem was and they constantly evaded telling the truth and spoke over me when I attempted to explain.

112008030083620064886,1615699347753,The nail tech didn’t do my cuticle nor did she scrape my feet. She argued with me when I said I wanted my cuticles done & told me to apply cuticle oil instead. So why would I need a spa for that?? She argued with me & didn’t agree to apply gel on my toes & applied the normal nail paint. She said she won’t scrape feet as the dead skin would come back again. Isn’t that the whole point of coming to a spa. Worst thing is she applied nail paint for my fingers & then did the scrub. I hated every second of my stressful spa day.

113474230416991486027,1550942611072,"My husband and I rented from Douglass Properties at their Stonehorse at Wandermere location. We signed a 2 year *binding lease*.  About a year and a half in, we found the perfect house for us for sale by accident. We weren't looking to purchase a home, but it was in an amazing location, newly renovated, and had old time charm. We carefully reviewed our lease, which stated verbatim that in order to terminate the lease, we would have to give notice at least 20 days prior to the 1st of the month. Along with this, we would have to provide $3,388 to break the lease. A dream home was worth the cancellation fee.

This was in December, which has 31 days. We dotted every i, and crossed every t and brought the entire fee in good faith before going in to the office to give our 20 day notice. It was December 12th. Go ahead. I'll let you count. Spoiler alert, it's 20 days. However after giving them our notice, the manager informed us that, per legal custom in WA State, the last day is not counted. That's great for customs! That's also great for WA  State!  But our lease and the language therein is BINDING. It does not include this legal custom in the language; therefore, we appeased the terms of the lease. We made double sure of this and consulted a lawyer who specifically said this as well.

Unfortunately, the manager at Stonehorse is a rotten human being who manipulated us. Her heart is made of cash and a bottom line, and her eyes; dollar signs. She illegally refused our notice stating we were literally ""1 day too late"" because she couldn't possibly be a decent human being and actually go by what our lease said and count the last day of December. We gave our 20 day notice in person at the office, which they printed out for us to sign. Unbeknownst to us, they changed the notice to January 31st, and we didn't catch it after we signed, so they had the audacity to charge us an additional month's rent.

Money is absolutely not an issue for us. My husband and I are blessed financially. We could have easily payed this and been done with it, but the manipulation, and deliberately going against lease terms just to make an extra buck, is why I write this as a warning to steer clear of any Douglass Properties.

Let me add a post-script.  Our move out went badly.  Management had advance, written notice of our move out date and AFTER we had scheduled the U-Hauls and helpers they decided to re-surface the parking lots then. They would not adjust it.  They simply advised we ""drive on the grass behind the apartment building.""  This had two problems:  the trees made navigating the large truck impossible. We had to get a smaller one. That necessitated increase cost due to three more trips (and damage to the lawn because it rained).  The move was 150 miles each trip. We worked well past mid-night to comply and did not meet their deadline so they kept a portion of the deposit.  Bottom line: they have a double standard.  Tenants must abide by every rule they set down.  They do not.

One other word of caution...  your rent WILL increase each time you renew.  And not just a little.  Ask ahead so you know what to expect.",,,0x5491737b6e8211c1:0x83ee497ab61ac68e

We do have signs at both of our entrances and through out the property that say ""warning permit parking only"", there is not a time limit on parking as we do have a parking patrol that comes through out the day, and night looking for unauthorized vehicles, so that residents are ensured to have parking when they come home. It is unfortunate that your vehicle was towed, however there is warning signs and residents have had this policy since July of 2018.

They will tow your car if you back in to the space, there are no assigned parking for tenants so if you get home past 7 you have to park at the front of the property. You can forget about putting in a work order because they won't do anything about it for months. If you have an a/c in your window or on your porch in the 90* weather they threaten to evict you, but if you drive 40 mph through the parking lot nothing is done about it. If you are going to let your kids play at the park that is built for a 2 year old, you have to walk with them so they don't get hit. There are so many people moving out and braking leases because the manager is rude and rolls her eyes at you when you try to talk to her.

Instead they will make sure you don't get no options and will threaten you.
If you plan on moving here because the price is cheap make no mistake to move here they will find other ways to charge you so you pay more.
And forget about maintenance they don't exist.
And forget about getting your deposit back when you move.
The design of the apartments is cheaply made faucets break and leaky sewer pipes.
Appartments also have constant bug problem that seems to never end, Windows and doors are poorly sealed cold air blows from crevices.

This salon rents spots out to stylists to run their own  business and book their own appointrments with in the salon. I followed her from D Side salon. (I read reviews bout her there) And I found her to be very unprofessional in her appointment bookings. It was difficult to contact her, call and text no response! She booked me and texted 20 minutes before the appointment that she over booked herself. I scheduled again and she canceled on me again! The next day! She speaks sharply to her clients and I thought her to be tempermental and not worth the drama. She charges a high fee for color for her experience.
Update...I saw pics of my hair recently from her hair cuts. Not what I asked for and too short. She was so confident I trusted her but not anymore. I found a great salon in Portland that is worth the drive. So glad I dropped her.",,,0x5495a8b058c7f127:0xe1e6f5a5630ed417

102718510774609742932,1563120092773,"Wish I'd looked more closely at the reviews on here before I got my room. Just like one said I am absolutely shocked that Red Lion would put their name on a place like this. If this is a newly acquired property that they are going to upgrade, warn us before we book the room and don't charge Red Lion rates!! This place is run down. It smells dank.

As others said. It's not well managed. I booked a room for my birthday with a jacuzzi tub. Thinking I was going to treat myself, but for some reason there were none available. All I get is, well we work with Expedia and they sent over a different reservation then you actually reserved. Didn't matter that I had an email showing that I had booked a premium suite. I saw that they wanted to charge another guy $15 for changing his room. They should have given me at least $150 back for this.

After getting to my room and seeing how wrong it was. A jacuzzi suite probably would have been worse. This was a definitely sleep on top of the blankets kind of place. I've attached a couple of pictures. I am not sure what the heck is all over this chair. But I'm sure if we had a blacklight we would all want to throw up!  As another reviewer also said; it was hot as Hades in this room! Turned the AC on full-blast and went to dinner. Gone for a couple of hours and came back and it was still way too hot. Didn't cool down until the middle of the night.

Breakfast was not impressive either. I would say the one positive about the breakfast is they actually had scrambled eggs. Other than that just typical. For spending almost $150 for the night, I could have had so much better just down the road!

that's for the managers replies to the comments. They sure don't seem to be getting anywhere do they?! You have wonderful responses thanking people for their opinions, but obviously nothing is being done to change the situation. Lower your rates or do something differently 😉","Dear Ronnie,
All guest comments are welcome and appreciated, and we take all feedback to heart. We want to sincerely apologize for the miscommunication with Expedia about your room type. Unfortunately, when guests use third-party services to complete their reservation, we cannot guarantee the room preference selected will be available at check-in. We hear your concerns and our team is working to implement a swift solution for the benefit of future guests. It would be an honor to make it up to you the next time you're visiting the area.",1563483649922.0,0x549e1f34a2dec085:0xbb430997fe802dba
107941347516691898548,1562518659167,"For lack of better words this place is a dump. I am honestly kind of surprised that Red Lion will put there name on it. From the minute you pull up you can tell that it is not well maintained. The paint is worn off the building, there is junker cars, that look like people are living in them in the parking lot, and the location is questionable in general.
The room was average but very outdated. When I got to my room it was about 10,000 degrees as the AC was not turned on. After turning on the AC, the room did not cool to a liveable level until sometime during the night after I had slipped into heat induced unconsciousness. The price they charged is mind blowing. For just a few dollars, a night, more you can stay at much nicer hotels about 4 miles away. With the condition of this place I would expect to pay no more that about 59 bucks a night. At this point I will consider it a success if when I go out to my car it is still there and hasn't been broken into.","Dear Doug,

109273790889033912377,1622929031960,"I've gone back and forth about writing this review but after brushing my hair out after showering today and really seeing just how damaged it is, I decided to go ahead with it.  I went in for a balayage that I had purchased a Groupon for. After reading reviews I was very excited to go in and upon arriving, my stylist greeted me and looked at the pictures I brought for inspiration. She was very sweet! She assured me that the pictures I brought were great and the balayage was very doable since the base color was very close to what I had. I told her I had previously colored my hair out of a box but that it was a couple months ago and was where the reddish color came from. Still said it was very doable! After three hours and having bright blonde roots, and pink bottoms at one point, I left the salon very disappointed. My closest friends barely could tell anything was done to my hair at all by the time it was all said and done. I could tell that my hair was pretty badly damaged the next day after showering when my hair literally stretched as I brushed it. It is frizzy and kinky now.

Here's the thing: I GET that you can't predict the outcome every time. There was an unforeseen reaction with my hair. Cool, fine, I get it. HOWEVER, if there had been some communication of that at the beginning of the appointment when I showed her the picture I may have opted to try something different instead or waited until the box color grew out. Instead it was three awkward, long hours for both of us and I walked out bummed by the end of it. Even my haircut was disappointing but by that point I didn't have the energy to say anything. The stylist knew I was not happy- there was an undeniable vibe from both of us that this was not how it was supposed to go, but no solution was offered. 😞 The color and cut will be fine- it will grow out and I can get a new haircut but the damage to my hair is something I now have to pay to get fixed on top of already having paid for a disappointing cut and color too.",,,0x54905781b47b5889:0xcbaa77cfcbbe9a5f

I arrived for a balayage and cut, I was already blonde, just wanted to go a little lighter and get a layered trim.

3 hours into my head/neck cramping while being left in the sink... I realized something was wrong. My stylist came around to check on me about every 20 minutes, and tried to get someone (I’m assuming salon owner) to take a look and see how they could fix it.

Long story short, my hair turned out a flat, brassy and yellowish-orange tone — I didn’t have the heart to tell them how bad I felt as I left, I figured I’d cut my losses as I’d already wasted an entire day and missed another appointment that evening because I was stuck there twice as long as normal/expected.

It was so loud I asked her to turn it off. There was more music playing in a different room and it was clashing and giving me a headache. It sounded like she was trying to cover up other sounds if you know what I mean. I could hear a man  in a different room grunting and moaning. She also would just leave out the room  whenever a walk in  customer came in. Taking time out my payed time to juggle customers. She also would speak Chinese loudly to the other lady in a whole other room during my massage- seemed like she was talking bad about me right in front of me. It was very  unprofessional. She tried to up sell me during my massage and asked me if the other lady could come in and massage me at the same time for more money. I said no this is fine. I've had many massages  in my life- from very upscale $200 an hour types at award winning spas to reflexology walk in places- and this was by far the strangest experience. She asked a lot of personal questions and was very judgmental. She talked about herself a lot. She made a a couple very rude racial comments. She obviously felt superior to me. She even asked me how much money I make in a year- which I did not answer. I was just trying to relax and needed a massage for my sore muscles. The lotion she used seemed very cheap and artificial. It felt like a very unbalanced rushed massage. I had to tell her what I wanted because it seemed like she was just going to rub my arms for as long as possible to pass the time. Her movements were very fast. Not as soothing and relaxing like it would be at a legit professional spa. I don't even write reviews but I'm so irritated by my experience that I'm writing this now instead of feeling relaxed afterwards. I can see there are a couple more bad reviews like mine.. and the rest are clearly fake reviews made by the ladies that work there or they're regular male clients who get they're ""happy endings"".

We had to really push to replace a broken dryer, and received an even older smaller one. Bathtub was recaulked every month or so until our last month on the lease when it was replaced.

Also, the North side if the building is insanely loud with garbage, recycling, or food waste trucks coming almost every day before the crack of dawn, across from a fire station, and near the hospital.

I was a little worried when Taylor left from the front office, but Jessica is Amazing and has made up for her absence! I have a list of pros and cons below, but the main reason I have for moving is it is just too expensive. Rent went up when I renewed my lease, and to renew again it would have also gone up to where I would be paying over $2,000 monthly for a 2 bed 1.5 bath apartment as a single parent. That price should cover a 3 bedroom 2 bath in a nice area... If you can afford to pay this price, it is not a terrible place to live and I would recommend it to those without children and a higher income than average.

Pros:
Homey experience with the amount of trees and layout
Parking is decently close to apartment
Hot tub easily accessible
Close to schools and grocery
Maintenance worked fairly quickly
Heated lamp in the bathroom

Cons:

No weekend trash pick up
Lawns not well kept

104211101403333358766,1550401313655,"We loved living here for 1.5 years. Vaulted ceilings, nice grounds, great manager (her name was Taylor, she's gone now), and a 24 hour hot tub! It all went south after our original year lease was up. The new apartment manager Sam comes off as laid back, buddy buddy, and hard working. I think maybe he is all those things and more, but he's stretched to thin and doesn't have a experienced enough staff to support him, thus he in turn has no time to train new people how to handle ALL the important stuff that ONLY HE KNOWS HOW TO DO.
So when it was time to sign our NEW lease for the upcoming year (with a rent increase of about 80 dollars over the last year) I was not surprised when Sam said he would get the lease ready for us to sign- ""tomorrow.""  For the next 3 months ""tomorrow"" was all I heard from him.
He was like Little Orphan Annie.
At one point on the ""online portal"" there was a document that I though; was the new lease. It had our new rent of 1769 marked down and some utilities, so I clicked accept or sign or whatever the button said. Finally I thought it was done. That's when I realized our rent bill had skyrocketted to over $2200. Sam claims since we didn't sign a new lease that makes us 'month to month."" I never wanted to be month to month, I didn't ask to be month to month, and there are absolutely NO advantages to it, its just a loop hole they can use to make money. I told Sam we never agreed to pay 2200+ per month, nor WOULD WE pay that amount.
Sam said, ""My Hands are tied."" So naturally I asked to speak to 32ee whose hands were not tied. This is where it gets ridiculous. The Seasons is owned and operated by a GIANT company called Greystar. Sam would not give me a phone number for his Regional Manager- he insisted that I would receive a phone call from them. I gave it 2 days, and since no one had reached out to me by now and we were due to be evicted in 2 more days, I started calling every Greystar contact number I could find online, and I sent a dozen emails by way of the 'contact' submission forms on greystar websites. I truly believed that once I got a regional manager on the phone they would hear me out and see what a ridiculous farce our bill and subsequent eviction were.
...
...
I was flat out ignored. I honestly called the Seattle Gteystar office 400 times in one afternoon, and not once did anyone answer that phone. Nor did they call me back after hearing my desperate voicemails, or reply to any of the  nearly a dozen emails I submitted explaining the situation.
I have been a manager for many, many years, in both retail and food service. I did not know how vastly different property management really was. Honestly I was and still am appalled. While Greystar's websites claims it is""operated with the highest integrity and character in delivering world-class services to residents,"" in reality they care so little about integrity and character that when a loyal resident had a complaint/problem, they handled it by ignoring me completely.  If we can't communicate with a company like this, we are left with just a court hearing during which to attempt to resolve the issue. But the court doesn't care about my story, it seems unrelated to them, I still owe rent for living there and I have not paid it, therefore the ruling is in greystars favor. The terrifying thing about what I learned is that a big company like Greystar, one who has lawyers in the wings and unlimited patience, can literally do whatever they want, say I owe them ANY amount of rent, and not only can I NOT do anything about it, but I will be forced to comply by the court, the law, and the Sherrif, who at this point, is basically just Greystar's henchman, doing their dirty work. I don't think this is right.","Hi Brian Mcginnis, we regret to hear that you are displeased with your recent experience with us. It is discouraging to learn of your experience with us.

It is very practical and tasteful, with public co-working space, as well as private meeting rooms to meet clients. My office is on the second floor and I really recommend the second floor. They have two awesome receptionists who are so helpful. I think having the receptionists in the waiting room adds validity to my young and growing business. They answer calls and transfer them to my office, as well as greet my clients and let me know they have arrived. There is a break room fully stocked with flavored waters, a tea selection, coffee and cookies. It is so nice to be able to break the ice with a client I have just met by sharing these amenities. The Gateway Center is clean, quiet, and professional. There is an on-site property manager who runs the center really well. I am really glad I signed the lease almost a year ago now.

Our apologies that your touring experience was below par at our community. We were unable to locate your name in our records, but if you have any unanswered questions we are happy to get the answers for you. Please feel free to reach out via my contact information below.

The rooms were crowded with a queen bed and two bunk beds, a tiny round table with a chair, and not much room for anything else--including luggage. You have to bring your own bedding and towels although they do provide a shower mat and a soap dispenser at the sink. Don't forget a hair dryer!

The things that really brought my rating down? The water in our room's shower never did get warm. I went down the hall to use the shower in another room, and it had almost no water pressure.

Meals are served family style, which is fine, but the food is all placed on the tables before the campers are allowed into the dining hall. By the time we got in and seated and had the food passed around, sometimes it was completely cold. There was no way to rewarm it that we could see.

We moved out in June, shortly after it became ""Pavilion"" and it has been a headache ever since!  They claimed we only paid half our last month's rent (which was paid in full before the first of the month) so we had to submit bank statements to prove it was paid. Well then they lost our bank statements (and our forwarding address which I have a copy of the notice of move out we gave them with the address). Then they found our bank statements. And two months later after constantly nagging them they FINALLY figured out that they had applied it to the wrong apartment! So then they needed to update our move out statement, without the rent amount that they thought we didn't pay. It has been a month now of weekly calls or emails and being told it will be sent to me and I still haven't seen a thing from them. I only ever spoke to one person who made an effort to solve the issue immediately,  everyone else has blown me off or passed me off. I've been patient and courteous but at this point I'm fed up! Do not live here. The cheap rent is not worth the poor management.

UPDATE! After spending six months, post move out, resolving a charge they tried to apply that turned out to be false. Now a year and a half after moving out, and a year after supposedly resolving the last issue, we have now received a call from a collections agency claiming we had an unpaid ulities bill. I have copies of the emails from management telling me that i did not owe anything more. I am APPALLED that they are attempting ANOTHER false charge. Now I have a debt collector threatening to ruin my credit. I will be speaking with the apartment management tomorrow.

DO NOT RENT HERE! IT IS A HUGE SCAM!",,,0x549056ff4c2e52f5:0x2b76e8689670c03a
105377081683183394310,1515180731415,"Avoid this place! Dirty, thin walls, overpriced rent, terrible staff.

Trash is a huge problem here. You're charged a mandatory trash valet fee and the garbage is always piled up with seagulls and crows dragging it throughout the property. Lack of recycling is a problem and they forget to pick up your trash too.

I stayed on the bottom floor of a 2bdrm 2bath unit and could hear every step from above and animals running and barking above me.

Another rental property taking advantage of people by charging ridiculous rent prices. At this point just by a house.

This place is supposedly under new management and I can say they're just a bad as the previous one. I've been lied to by an assistant manager who supposedly doesn't work there anymore as of a week ago or something.

6 weeks to have my oven repaired under the new management.

I was charged a $135 cleaning fee on top of the  $125 carpet cleaning fee even though I left the place clean and all that was needed was the required carpet cleaning which I accept since everyplace charges this fee upon move out and is noted upon signing lease. The cleaning charge was unnecessary. I cleaned, kitchen counters, cabinets, stove top and trays, refrigerator, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Everything was the way I received it when moving in.  Over the past 14 years I've rented at many apartments  this is the only place that charged me a cleaning fee. When I challenged this fee I was told it's in my lease agreement with trinity the previous management but Mark couldn't show me this because he doesn't have access and I would need to talk to the ""NEW"" assistant manager,  then he said it was the law that I be charge this fee. The women who was taking my final payment asked me if I pulled out all the appliances and cleaned behind them. I've never needed to pull out appliances to clean behind them anywhere. Mind you I was also only here for a year. Why would you tell tenants to move your expensive appliances risking injury or damage to the apartment or appliance?

Stay AWAY from this place if you want to be in the area I recommend Glenn Park my experience there was far better and the staff were more professional (Didn't blame previous management for shortcomings) or better yet just buy a house","Hi Christopher,

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback, and we're very sorry to hear you were disappointed with your Pavilion experience. We'd like to address a couple of the issues you mention in your review in order to provide some clarification.

First, we've taken additional measures and hired more staff to assist in detailed grounds clean-up. Because we have centralized compactors on site, Trash Valet was implemented some time ago as an additional amenity to prevent residents from needing to lug their trash a long distance in order to properly dispose of it. If there are ever any issues with missed trash pickup, we urge residents to please contact the office immediately. The possibility of additional recycling installations is currently under review with the City and pending approval.

We truly apologize for the length of time it took for us to install your new oven. We recently hired a new Service Manager and maintenance staff to improve work order response times. While we're still catching up on some backlogged work orders, we're beginning to see a vast improvement in response times.

If you'd like to review your move-out charges in more detail and discuss any discrepancies, please call the office anytime to speak with our community manager. We were lucky to have you as a member of our community, and we wish you all the best.

Sincerely,
The Pavilion Apartments Team",1516401734336.0,0x549056ff4c2e52f5:0x2b76e8689670c03a
100463908347951887882,1502594807564,When Prime took over I was concerned if the changes was going to be bad or good. Based on the people before them I thought they could only go up from there and I was right. It was a little rocky when they first started because they had a lot of things that needed to be fixed and taken care of that the previous company left undone or disorganized. They stepped up the the plate and batted a home run. No matter what problem I have or need fixing they are quick to take care of it. I love my unit and take care of it and they take care of me. I recently had a issue with my check from my bank and thought they was going to give me a hard time about taken care of it. I have never been late with rent in 4 years and it was not their fault that I was having problems with my bank. The allowed me time to fix the problem although I still have to pay a return check fee but because I replaced the payment so quickly I did not have to pay a late fee. This was an unusual situation and I know under most circumstances I would have to pay a $100 late fee. I'm not writing this solely only that experience alone but the over all experience with Prime since they have taken over. They have done a lot of upgrades and not just put lip stick on the pig like the previous company before them. I'm staying as long as they let me.,"Thank you so much, Rita!

103993421385806918778,1490727282900,"I gave 2 stars one for previous office staffs(Trinity), and another for floor plan. I just moved out from this complex. I have lived there for 1 year. This complex has many good things also has lots of bad things. At first, I want to talk about the good things. First of all, the location is very good. There are good markets near this complex. I think that is very convenient thing. I liked to walk to Fred Meyer and shopping. Second, the floor plan is good. I like my 2bed 1bath floor plan. There is huge storage at terrace. In addition, pantry and closets are enough to organize. Third, there are lots of parking spot. Never get in trouble cause parking. Last good thing is kind (previous) office staffs. I was in trouble when I moved in this complex. Kristen gave us a lot of help. I really appreciate it from my heart.
However, I have to talk about bad things because the bad things are really horrible. The worst was my neighbors. My upstairs and downstairs made lot of noise. They never care about what time, what date was it. I really wonder how many people are there living in my upstairs and downstairs. They run, made lots of heavy footsteps, and turn on music or TV so loudly. This apartment is old, so the ceiling and walls are thin like paper that is why I could hear everything from my neighbors. Of course, the floor makes rattling sound when I walk. In addition, my downstairs filed their garbage in front of their door, so I was worried about bugs. Dogs’ pee dropped from my upstairs into my balcony for a while. (Recently, it drops AGAIN!!!!!)I have never heard this kind problem before. This complex looks good outside, but inside Interiors are cheap. The laundry machine is soooooo old. It looks more than 30 years old. The bath tub paint lifting. Maintenance are jock. It took very long time they coming for treat the problem. Many cars turn on the music so loudly, and the engines made loud noise. Some cars race in complex at midnight. They also never care time even that time is midnight. This complex is so dirty. Tenants throw the trash everywhere, broken bottles are everywhere. I heard this is a marijuana free community, but I can smell everywhere include in my house. This is very serious problem because I have a baby. The door lock is so silly. First time I saw the lock, I though it will be very convenient, but exactly not. I paid for the lock 10 dollars every month, but I have to change the batteries myself. Also the key usually did not work. During last 3month, I did not use the key. In addition, this apartments’ homepage said here is a gated community, but the gate has never closed! Why they advertises with that.
It is so thankful that I do not need to live there anymore. Consider to move in this community if you find a new place.","Hi Darae,

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. We're pleased to hear there were plenty of things you enjoyed about life at Pavilion, but we'd like to address a few of the issues you mention in order to provide some clarification.

First, we're sorry you experienced ongoing problem with your neighbors. Because Prime has only been managing Pavilion for the last 2 months, we don't have much background information regarding your specific situations aside from what you included in your review. For current and future residents, please note that we encourage you to always reports disturbances to the management office and/or courtesy patrol, so we may help you alleviate the problem(s) ASAP.

Our janitorial team walks the property 7 days a week cleaning up excess trash, waste, broken glass, etc. We encourage residents to report areas in need of extra attention to the office, so we can be sure to address them immediately.

In regards to your door lock, all of our apartment homes are equipped with key fobs. If the batteries are low, the fob will malfunction, and you'll need to use your regular key to unlock the door.

We've been told by current residents that the gates haven't worked for months; therefore, we are now in the process of gathering estimates for repairs. We'll be sure to get the gates back up and running ASAP.

Thank you for your residency as well as your insight. We wish you all the best in your new home.

Besides that there is absolutely NO parking, and if you do happen to find a spot don't ever leave because it'll be gone as soon as you come back from work or errands. Be prepared to park a fair ways away from your apartment and have to walk in the dark to your apartment on a regular basis. Also, the gate is almost always locked and everyone has a key card so when you invite family or friends over they will have a VERY difficult time getting in, they have to scroll through all the names until they find yours then it will call you and you have to press a number...it's pretty tedious. When they DO fix things you might want to make sure your not sleeping because they came over and fixed my garbage disposal without knocking one morning and when my husband walked out of the bedroom he saw them.

Then there's the ANTS....they crawl out of the HOLES in the molding and when you call to complain they just tell you everyone has ants and act like its no big deal.

Being locked out...I was locked out of my apartment several times because the spot the deadbolt sits was stripped and the screws were constantly loosening. It looked like someone had broken into the apartment and the maintenance had done a bad job rearing it..just like all the GIANT HOLES in my molding that the ants came through.

Thank you for your feedback, and we're sorry to hear of your recent frustrations. We'd like to address a few of the issues you mention in order to provide some clarification on these items.

Our janitorial team walks the property 7 days a week cleaning up excess trash, waste, broken glass, etc. We encourage residents to report areas in need of extra attention to the office, so we can be sure to address them immediately.

Regarding parking, assigned carports are available for $40/month and garages can be rented for $100/month. We have a towing company that tags cars at the beginning of the week providing residents with a 48-hour window to resolve the issue or else they'll be towed. Now that Prime has taken over Pavilion's management, we are actively towing inoperable vehicles and/or cars with expired registration. The previous management company was only tagging cars (not towing them); therefore, some vehicles unfortunately sat in the same spot for much longer than they should have.

Our security company, Valor Security, is on site every night from 8:00am until 5:00pm. The officers can be reached by phone during those hours at 206-340-6000

As for our valet trash service, there are specific rules that must be followed in order for residents' trash to be retrieved properly. All trash bags need to be placed inside the designated receptacle by 8pm in order for them to be picked up.

We hope this information helps. If you have further questions or concerns, please call or drop by the office anytime to speak with our community manager, Sandra.

Rainier from my kitchen window, my favorite part about calling this place home is the fact that the owner takes pride in his building and doesn't farm out his responsibilities to a property management company.

I have a unit over garages so I don't have any neighbors so noise has never been an issue. Large closets accommodate living in a small 500 sq/ft apartment.

Our car has been broken into twice in three months (edit, make that 3 times) and it is in a shared garage that is always locked. We take the stereo out now lest that get stolen too. Recently someone tried to kick down a neighbors door. We have homeless people doing drugs and sleeping in the stairwell. One even had the nerve to knock on my neighbors door and tell her to turn her TV down. It is insane how much we have to call the cops. About 6 months ago a dog (or person) pissed in the stairwell. The smell is still there because they won't replace the carpet. The apartment complex refuses to do a thing about any of this. There are no locks on the doors to the inside of the building and the apartment doors only have a single deadbolt. They say anymore locks is somehow a fire hazard. Also, don't let this place tell you they do background checks. I have seen people sell drugs out of their apartments and one guy comes back with a truck full of car parts and other miscellaneous stuff about every other day. Others will hit on and harass women who walk or drive by. The kids aren't much better than the adults. There is a group of teens around here that like to occasionally light explosives or fireworks in the middle of the night. As someone who has PTSD, I have panic attacks daily now. I am highly disappointed in our slum lords.
I will keep updating this with details. If I deter even one person and save them anxiety and years off their life, that is enough for me.
EDIT: For those curious, I lived in the building directly in front of the hole in the gate that leads to Walmart. I heard from multiple people while living there AND the cops that our building had more crimes than buildings on the other side of the property. Once again, this place doesn't care about your safety. If you must move here, try to get an apartment as far from the Walmart as possible (your car will still be broken into though).",,,0x549000d548981a41:0x9a352100676fc49d

113076843854529323370,1531904370301,"Horrible, second week my apartment caught fire! WHY because the tenant prior me had a child that put toys in the heating unit and maintenance never cleaned the heating ducts! They don't care about the safety of the tenants, I slipped and fell on ice, and was told by Jennifer they would not salt until the next day, nor would they put up a warning sign!!!
They also do not clean the appartment landings, or the grounds regularly.
RUN, RUN, RUN!!!! LOOK ELSEWHERE YOU CAN GET A NICER PLACE FOR YOUR MONEY! The fire department came out and there was a small fire, the Tumwater fire department has a report, which is public. Furthermore, a diligent management company would have checked heating vents prior renting the unit or at least warned other tenants with children of this potential hazard. As for the slip and fall this was witnessed by another tenant, all of which management was aware. After hours! An employee was walking the grounds, and it's obvious that a tenant could be seriously insured. The staff was much more concerned with getting home on time, rather then put up a danger sign!!! There are also other reviews which state that this management company has changed stories, tenants have even been called liars. This management Company is dishonest, and will target you if you complain. This manage Comany even called me while out of town to tell me my dog barked all nite, me and my son where out of State so my dog was at a doggie hotel, they constantly harass tenants! Potential tenants should talk to other tenants, check the fire departments records, and do your research. The best thing about this apartment is the tenants are very nice. Read the contract carefully they have construction on going  without an end date the gated ground are not mandatory they view the gate as a gift, the parking is really bad after 4 pm parking is not assigned, and the construction company doesn't clean up after themselves, nails, dirt, holes uncovered on going for ten months, without end!","Your apartment did not catch on fire, I would caution you and your son Tristan to be honest when leaving reviews. We would appreciate that and I imagine prospects would as well. TO CLARIFY there was a small plastic or rubber toy placed in the heating vent by a child which was not noticed until the heating vents were used again and omitted a smell. There was NO FIRE or damage to the apartment.

I thought I could move past it, but once I got home, I realized I had payed a high price for hair that I just didn't want (it turned out much darker than I had hoped). I called the salon back and they were really understanding and booked me a new appointment to fix it. Perfect!

But when the day before the appointment rolled around, I got a confirmation call and the first thing they told me was ""Just so you know, this isn't a free service"".  I thought it was odd they hadn't told me that when I rescheduled, but maybe it's standard practice (I'm new to hair salons). I asked how much it would be to fix it and she said ""it depends"". I couldn't get a straight answer and I couldn't afford to shell out another $400 to fix my hair so I unfortunately had to cancel. I felt really disappointed and like my experience didn't matter. My hair is going to have to stay the way it is until I can afford to get it fixed.

I'm glad they're doing well but I unfortunately won't be going back.",,,0x54910bc884ccbc77:0xcc5a6a6b0587b795

They even went as far as calling CPS on me and they got into trouble for filing a false report. After my lease was up they refused to renew it so I had to find another place to live. After moving out they claimed they had to send a hazmat team into the building and tried to charge me the fees... I had taken pictures of everything before I left... I asked them why they had to send a team in and they said for dog feces... I asked for photo proof and they sent me a picture of ONE PIECE of dog poop... OUTSIDE.... ON THE CORNER... of the concrete slab... I asked come of the neighbors about the hazmat team and they told me there was never a team sent in. I have other friends and family who have lived there and they have had the same complaint about how they were treated. Every year they increase the rent at least $100 from what I understand.

With fenced yards to call your own, and a pet friendly atmosphere you can have ALL of your family members with you. There are 2bd, 3bd, and 4bd options, along with a community and fitness center for your convenience. The staff in the office are so nice and accommodating. Also, the whole complex is right across the street from both Windsor Elementary and Westwood Middle Schools. The neighborhood is quiet and away from major traffic areas, but close enough to amenities. We love living here, and we hope you will too.",,,0x549e3da6f069e4b7:0x1fe9e3c879297492

It’s pretty run down and also dirty. The night stand and telephone had so much dust collected on it, there were random socks under the beds that didn’t belong to us and it was just super dirty under there and in the entire room. The shower head had so much lime buildup on it, the mattresses were very old and stained, the outlets were all in inconvenient places next to the light switches and if you charge your phone it’s going to be dangling off the wall. There was a spot for a mini fridge but there was no fridge. I cut my toe on a tiny piece of glass by the door, so who knows if it even gets vacuumed in there.. I understand it’s kind of in the middle of no where but they could sure use a much needed remodeling and a much needed DEEP cleaning as well as a better cleaning in general. Some man was also cat calling my friends and I outside one of the rooms and said something about selling us drugs, should’ve called the police on them but we chose to ignore them. I’m giving 2 stars cause the workers were nice. Glad we survived but we probably won’t be back though lol",,,0x54995e9fb1fedbf1:0xb127561fc22c9e62

Just to update, the owner fired two sets of managers since I last wrote this. The new manager (Amber) is incompatent and doesn't have any idea what she is doing. Amber lets the house keeper show up whenever she wants to and twice Amber has accused my wife and I of doing things that we never did. The first time she tried to say that we let our dog make a mess of the motel room and the second time she accused us of braking the door to our room. The door was already broke when she put us in it and that was only after she had to give us a different room twice because there was something wrong with the room. Since Amber has taken over, any time that we have stayed there, we have not been put in a room where there wasn't something wrong with it. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give them a -5.

We walked around in the store for over 15mins and not a single employee asked us if we need assistance (store was not busy), 2. When we got upset that we couldn't get help the security guard said that we had to ask for assistance (people are walking in and getting assistance right away without asking), 3. finally after tracking down a sales representative, I asked her to bring me a belt in my size, she disappeared and never came back.

Some negatives would be Police coming and going often. Also, Firetrucks and ambulances make their rounds almost daily. Not sure if this is medical or drug related unfortunately. The maintenance team is here is awesome and they keep our apartments and the grounds spotless. There are a lot of families in here and kids tend to play in the street and parking stalls which always makes people nervous. I am always extra careful and have almost hit random kids with my cars more than I can count. I wish parents would keep a better eye out or teach their children street safety.

102193608551681908292,1522259987342,"This is an update from my previous review now that I have been living here for some time. My overall experience has been positive. The grounds are tended to regularly. Everything is brand new.  The parking is regulated so people aren't hogging parking or storing unused vehicles. This was an issue at previous properties. While it may seem tedious, it helps tenants who pay rent make sure they have a spot when they come home from work.

- The kids run around a lot. They are noisy and often play in the streets, run through the breezeways, and hang out in the rental office.

-The park isn't a park. It is basically modernized monkey bars enclosed in a fence. No slide, no swings, just a climbing structure.

-There are only a few regular sized parking spaces. All others are compact. They make it difficult to enter and exit a full sized vehicle.

- The property is designed to help the tenant save money. That being said, the pressure in the bathroom sinks are super low and take a while to heat up. Each room has its own heating but it's a base board unit that takes up an entire wall since you cannot place any furniture within a few feet of it so you lose space for furniture. All rooms besides the master are pretty small. You cannot use your own washer and dryer. All units have them but if you opt out, they're still there taking up space.

-There's a huge water heater in the guest bedroom closet so it takes lots of space and could be potentially dangerous if you have children.

- The amenities are cool BUT you may not use the pool, sport court, hot tub, rental office rooms, or computers when the office is closed.

- The office staff can be very accommodating and professional but can also be petty and cold if they are called out for something they don't follow through on. For example, there's no consistency when they receive tenant packages. They started out sending a text for each delivery but if they don't, they say it's a courtesy. They say you are able to reach them via text but if they don't respond it's suddenly just a courtesy. They will argue back and forth via text in defense instead of taking ownership of a mishap. If you report anything to corporate after talking with office staff, they just forward your concern back to office staff.

-They try and remain neutral in situations where they should be advocates of justice. I had a package stolen from me due to the postman placing my package in the wrong parcel locker. Instead of saying it is a federal offense to steal and the package needs to be returned, they said I misplaced it and IF it's found to return it.

-Some of the materials used are cheap so things like toilet seats become loose frequently, bath faucets become loose, cabinet laminate is starting to peel, closet doors come off the track, and the sliding screen door lock is finicky.

- You can't put certain things on the porch/balcony. If you have kids and don't live on a ground floor, you get called frequently about normal bumps and thumps.

-Private notices are posted on your door or your vehicle for everyone to see. They also complained to tenants via door post about things like sidewalk chalk on the sidewalk, mulch being on the sidewalk, and other things that the groundskeeper should be tending to.

I enjoy living here. It's a great location and don't have any pressing issues. These are all things I've brought up to the staff as well. Although some of these things are minor, it helps to be mentally prepared and lessen the initial shock factor.",,,0x549006f407f84679:0x60b6acaad2c6160b

Had to return the next day because they were broken before they even made it home. 3 months later we still have no slippers. Rude managers and employees had no idea what we were talking about on multiple occasions of calling. Only form of contact from manager was voicemails saying its out of her control. She told us they would have a shipment in april. Nothing. Its now the end of may and we recieved no calls or updates nothing. So today i call and request to speak to a manager. She was unprofessional and rude. Dont waste your money here theres plenty of other stores in spokane that sell the same quality for much less.

Elevators are often down creating 10 to 20 minutes to get off your floor or even back to your unit. Staff are very nice However. This is a construction flaw. There are only 3 elevators. One is reserved for people moving in or out. This leaves 2 to operate. And when one is down imagine the hundreds if folks trying to come home or leave in one elevator. Do your research fully as the MGMT company offers no concessions for these frequent frustrating events.","Hello John,
