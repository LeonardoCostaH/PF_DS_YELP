- The area is wonderful. No, it's not what many guidebooks will recommend for first-time tourists to San Francisco, but I PROMISE it is better than staying in Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square. The area feels really safe, is super close to ANY public transit you could need (it's literally just outside the door), and is a wonderful place to walk around and explore, with many nice restaurants and coffee shops. Could not say better things about the area for a traveler. 
- The hotel itself is very impressive. The lobby is beautiful and the elevators are beautiful and exciting! They were working on a gorgeous Christmas display while we were there. 
- The room was large especially for a city, very clean, and we fortunately booked a room with a balcony, and OMG, what an amazing view.

801,Estados Unidos,Habitación Doble con balcón y vistas a la bahía - 1 cama extragrande,1,En familia,"What is there not to like about the HYATT. It is always a wonderful hotel to stay at. My wife fell in love with the balcony with the bay view room. It is the only one we get. The staff are warm and welcoming from the valet drivers outside/entrance greeters are friendly,funny and professional. Every question i had they were mainly the ones to answer it for me. The front desk service had great customer service. They greeted me with a warm welcome to the establishment and because it was valentines day they had a beautiful red rose for my lady and champagne in the room. It made my wife feel special that day which they did all of it. Walking to my room I was even greeted by one of the service men. We had a little chat with laughter at the end, he saw me and my wife kind of struggling with our suitcases and even offered to help. I thought that was genuine for a worker that probably didn't even get paid to that job. So for the managers to the people in charge/owners of the facility. The front desk workers are awesome, but give a BIG notice and thank you to your workers that probably don't get the love and respect they should. And that is your frontline/entrance workers with amazing attitudes and knowledge for us/guest. The workers that are in the back stage that keep the place clean and in working order maid/handyman. They alone would be one reason I would come back to this hotel. Which I have numerous of times. So I hope you do something special for those workers that don't get the recognition that they deserve. Thank you all staff members for making my wife's valentines day one for the books. Facebook/Instagram friends and family wifes will be jealous on this one. Thank you for making me look like the dopest husband this year. Now tell your boss to throw you a LITTLE SOMETHING 😉 💰",12695.0,1,2021-02-15,0.3777930402930403

You are going into another building that is not even connected to the hotel. So when you pick lobby it takes you to a office lobby and not your hotel. I asked the lady/ security do I check in here. Looking at me confused she said you must be looking for the hotel. She then instructed me to go back in the elevator and go one floor down to the ""streets"". Once that elevator opens you are half way there. You are then walking across the way which is outside to get to the main entrance/ valet.

We had to keep calling front desk to see where our luggage was located. First Lady that answered front desk was very rude and short she never followed up on our luggages. We waited for another 45 mins no call back. Second time I called back to front desk the other lady apologized to me and asked me to placed on hold while she checked where out luggage was. 
She finally came back and told me that it was still sitting in storage and she will have someone bring it up.

The surroundings were fantastic, but the accommodations themselves left much to be desired. The rooms appeared slightly outdated and in need of refurbishment, which did not justify the high price tag.
Furthermore, the staff’s lack of responsiveness was a significant issue, and i felt that sometime that they need to learn how to act nice.
Adding to my dissatisfaction was the lack of parking facilities for guests. There were no on-site parking options, and I had to resort to a nearby parking lot, which charged an exorbitant fee of nearly $40 per night. The distance between the parking lot and the hotel was quite a walk, making it inconvenient, especially when carrying luggage or returning late in the evening.
